" Foreword to the Ninth Edition The Committee on International Taxation is one of the important non-standing Committees of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). As a partner in nation building, ICAI through this Committee submits Pre and Post-budget Memoranda pertaining to International Taxation. Apart from the same, the Committee time to time examines the tax laws, rules, circulars, notifications etc. relating to International taxation issued by the CBDT and sends suitable suggestions for improvements. The Committee also submits inputs/submissions to OECD from time to time on behalf of ICAI which have been duly acknowledged by OECD. Besides conducting various activities regularly like Diploma Course on International Taxation, oragnising Workshops/Seminars/ Conferences/ Refresher Courses/ Residential course, and preparing e-learning modules, one of the core activities of the Committee is to release publications relating to international taxation and transfer pricing and to revise its existing publication regularly. The ICAI through Committee on International Taxation has been issuing guidance for its members in respect of the Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The obligation of the members of ICAI is to express opinion on the accounts, records and documentation pertaining to international transactions and specified domestic transactions and therefore, it is expected from the members to have a through knowledge of transfer pricing and recent developments. The Committee has brought out the ninth edition of the Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 in which all the amendments made upto Finance Act, 2022, have been incorporated. I appreciate the efforts of CA. Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, Chairman, CA. Cotha S. Srinivas, Vice-Chairman and other members of the Committee on International Taxation who took timely steps to revise the Guidance Note on Report under section 92E of the Income Tax Act, 1961. I hope this publication would provide a lot of insight on the reporting requirements expected from members. Place: New Delhi CA. (Dr.) Debashis Mitra Date : 10-10-2022 President, ICAI"
" Preface to the Ninth Edition After opening up the economy the Government of India took note of the possibility of manipulation of transfer pricing resulting in shifting of income out of India on the one hand, and inadequacy of the then taxation regulations in dealing with that, on the other hand. Consequently, to deal with such situations in an effective manner, the Government, in 2001, introduced comprehensive transfer pricing regulations as Chapter X of Income-tax Act,1961(the Act), which deals with special anti-avoidance provisions regarding international transaction. One of the innovative measures to ensure self-compliance of the regulations was incorporation of requirement of filing of accountant’s report as per section 92E of the Act read with Rule 10E of Income Tax Rules, 1962 in Form 3CEB. Even though the duty to comply with the transfer pricing regulation rest upon the taxpayer, the responsibility of accountant is to examination of documents and information and provides report thereon. In this revised publication the committee has covered all the important update related to associated enterprises, international transactions, guidance related to selection of most appropriate methods, computation of ALP, adjustment thereof and documentation etc. In the emerging international transactions, some transactions are made which may not have bearing on profit of the enterprise. In those cases, identification of shifting of profit are to be identified and reported. Similarly, Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan 8, 9 and 10 which deals with intangible, Risk & Capital and high-risk transactions respectively explain how transfer pricing outcome determined in accordance with the actual conduct of related parties in context of contractual terms of transactions. Another important development in the area of international taxation, which is likely to impact transfer pricing concepts in future, is BEPS 2.0 pillar two approach recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The major objective of BEPS 2.0 pillar two is to prevent jurisdictions having lower tax and shorter economic activities but gaining higher tax advantages. In this age of digitalisation of economic activities, long existing concepts of taxation, including arm’s length principle are under threat. The way business"
" vi is being, and likely to be conducted, there are going to be newer challenges to tax administrations and tax advisors in ensuring true and full compliance of regulations. It is essential for the members of ICAI to be on top of the developments. This Guidance Note may be helpful in achieving this goal. I would like to express my sincere thanks to CA. (Dr.) Debashis Mitra President, ICAI and CA. Aniket S. Talati, Vice-President, ICAI , for being a guiding force behind all initiatives being taken by the Committee on International Taxation.

" Foreword to the Eighth Edition The emergence of unprecedented crisis due to Covid-19 pandemic has given rise to significant economic challenges across the world. Amidst the spread of the pandemic and the imposition of social and economic lockdowns, the world has come to an abrupt halt which has impacted production, demand and supply chain significantly. The delayed closure of books of accounts and availability of limited comparable data in public domain affects a suitable comparable transaction. In the present situation, the use of the comparable data related to last two financial years may not be the most ideal as those years were not disrupted by COVID-19. The existing transfer pricing approach may therefore be reviewed in current scenario which may consider the impact of significant decrease in business activities. The potential comparable transactions, comparability analysis including required adjustment therefore needs to be made appropriately and the same needs to be documented so as to substantiate the results. In light of the Covid pandemic, the reporting and disclosure requirement towards the international transactions is certainly challenging for the members of Institute of chartered accountants of India (ICAI). The ICAI through its Committee on International Taxation has been issuing guidance for its members in respect of Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The Committee has brought out the eighth edition of this Guidance Note in which all the amendments made upto Finance Act, 2020 have been incorporated. I would like to appreciate the efforts of CA. Nandkishore Chidamber Hegde, Chairman, CA. G. Sekar, Vice-Chairman, and all members of the Committee on International Taxation of ICAI for the initiative taken to revise the said publication in a timely manner for the benefit of the members and other stakeholders at large. I am sure that this revised and updated publication would be of immense use for our members practising in the area of Transfer Pricing in effectively discharging their professional responsibilities.

" Preface to the Eighth Edition The objective of transfer pricing is to curb the practices of shifting profits from associated entities in higher tax jurisdiction to associated entities in relatively lower tax jurisdiction through intra-group trade which ultimately reduces an MNE's worldwide taxes. The arm length price is a machinery provision which determines what an independent party would have paid under the same or similar circumstances. The transfer pricing analysis cannot be effective without understanding the associated enterprises, nature of transactions, industry, other regulatory factors. Also unlike many other countries, transfer pricing documentation and reporting is a statutory obligation cast on enterprises under the Income-tax act 1961. This Guidance Note was last revised in the year 2019. Keeping in view, the changes brought by the Finance Act 2020, the Committee on International taxation thought it was important to keep the members appraised and updated and thus decided to bring out the eighth edition of this Guidance Note. I am confident that this will benefit members and will enable them to discharge their reporting responsibilities. I extend my thanks to CA. Atul Kumar Gupta, President and CA. Nihar N. Jambusaria, Vice-President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India for being a guiding force behind the activities being undertaken by the Committee. I also whole heartedly acknowledge the efforts undertaken by Mr. S.P. Singh, Ex-IRS in revising this Guidance Note in a timely manner. Notably, Mr. S.P. Singh had been a part of the team that conceptualized Transfer Pricing law was introduced in India. We also appreciate the efforts of CA. Ankit Arora who assisted him in revision of this Guidance Note. I must make a mention of the large number of suggestions were received on the exposure draft of the Guidance Note hosted on ICAI’s website. The team lead by Mr SP Singh was pleased to examine each and every suggestion and recommended incorporation as felt necessary. I thank the members who took out their valuable time and shared their inputs/ observations with the Committee. I am also grateful for the unstinted support provided by Vice-Chairman  CA."

" Preface to the Seventh Edition Globalization is not new, but the pace of integration of national economies and markets has increased substantially in recent years. It has a significant impact on a country’s corporate income tax regimes. The increasing participation of multinational groups in economic activities in India has given rise to new and complex issues arising from transactions entered into between two or more enterprises belonging to the same multinational group. Transfer Pricing provisions thus have an important role to play. In order to facilitate our members in effective discharge of their responsibilities towards the reporting requirements of section 92E, the Committee on International Taxation decided to revise its “Guidance Note on Report under section 92E of the Income tax Act, 1961” The exposure draft of this Guidance Note was hosted on ICAI’s website for inputs from members at large.

" Foreword to the Sixth Edition Since 2001, when sections 92A to 92F were inserted for the first time in the Income-tax Act, 1961, there has been rapid evolvement of the field of Transfer Pricing. Application of the complex provisions of transfer pricing require determination of proper income arising from international transactions where either or both the parties involved happen to be non-resident(s). Global existence of the multinational enterprises has augmented the number of cross border transactions with the associated enterprises. At the same time, the related law has also evolved and has posed various challenges for stakeholders. The responsibility of examining the records and issuing the report under section 92E is on our members. Laws in respect of transfer pricing are complex but our members have been discharging their responsibilities ably. ICAI too guides its members in respect of the ever changing complex laws of Transfer Pricing. This Guidance note on Report under section 92E of the Income tax Act, 1961 provides guidance to the members in this regard. The publication was last revised in the year 2016. However, in order to keep our members updated, the Committee on International Taxation of ICAI took up the task of revising the publication this year also. It is a pleasure to note that Committee on International Taxation of ICAI has brought out the sixth edition of “Guidance Note on report under section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Transfer Pricing)” in a timely manner. I compliment CA. Sanjiv K. Chaudhary, Chairman, Committee on International Taxation of ICAI and CA. N.C.

" Preface to the Sixth Edition Taxation laws pertaining to cross border transactions have always been complex as also interesting. Frequent changes in the taxation laws have made the area more dynamic. Having dynamism and the complexity involved, over a period of time, Transfer Pricing has surfaced as a distinct area of practice for our members. The onerous responsibility of examining the records and thereafter issuing Report in Form No. 3CEB under section 92E of the Income tax Act, 2017 is being discharged efficiently by our members. Time and again changes in law pose challenges which are to be addressed in a most professional manner. In order to guide and support the members, ICAI through its dedicated Committee on International Taxation takes all efforts in the said direction. Issuance of this revised version of the “Guidance Note on Report under section 92E of the Income tax Act, 1961” is also a step in the said direction. Even though the Guidance Note was recently revised in the year 2016, considering the changes effected by the Finance Act, 2017 and OECD TP Guidelines (2017), the Committee thought it fit to update the same this year also. The exposure draft of this Guidance Note was hosted on ICAI’s website for inputs from members at large. The suggestions so received have been considered and appropriately incorporated. I extend my heartiest thanks to CA. Nilesh S. Vikamsey, President and  CA.

" Foreword to the Fifth Edition Change is inevitable when it comes to Indian tax laws. Time and again, frequent changes in laws have presented their own challenges before our members. Increasing cross border transactions, use of technology and the like have added more complexity to the tax laws. With increase in number of multinational companies having subsidiaries and branches all over the world, there has been a tremendous augment in the number of transactions with the associated enterprises. Our members have an onerous responsibility of examining the documents so maintained by the enterprises operating in India and express an opinion thereof in Form No.3CEB with regard to the compliance of the legal requirements. This Guidance note provides a support to the members in respect of the manner of exercising due diligence while inspecting international transactions and also specified domestic transactions. The document was last revised in the year 2013.Since then many changes have been made in the related rules. I am pleased to mention that Committee on International Taxation of ICAI has done a commendable task by bringing out with the fifth edition of “Guidance Note on report under section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Transfer Pricing)”. With these little steps, ICAI endeavors to ensure that its members are always well equipped to face challenges in this complex area also. I compliment CA. Nihar Niranjan Jambusaria, Chairman and CA.

" Preface to the Fifth Edition With the increased level of cross border transactions and Capital mobility, Transfer Pricing has emerged as a distinct field of practice for our members.

The Committee on International Taxation of ICAI which is dedicated Committee for this field is making all efforts to update the members in this area. The recently launched Diploma in International Taxation imparts 60 hours out of 120 hours of Professional training in Transfer Pricing by various experts in the field.

Apart from the above there have been one day or two days programmes that are organized in respect of International Taxation. One of the important effort made by the Committee for providing guidance to the members in discharging their reporting responsibility in an effective manner is to revise the Guidance Note on Report under section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961(Transfer Pricing). This Guidance Note was last revised in August 2013, when Part C was inserted in Form No.3CEB to report specified domestic transactions under section 92BA. Since then there have been various developments in law; identifying some; notification of safe harbor rules in respect of arm’s length price under section 92C or section 92CA; notification of provisions/rules for roll back mechanism; range concept and use of multiple year data for determination of arm’s length price; increased threshold limit for the applicability of the specified domestic transaction and the like. This revised version of the Guidance Note contains all these important changes for guidance of the members practicing in this area. My sincere thanks to CA. M. Devaraja Reddy, President and CA.

" Foreword to the Third Edition The law relating to transfer pricing is dynamic and the members of the Institute are getting acquainted with the practical implications of the law and the rules relating to transfer pricing. The Finance Act, 2012 has made major Amendments such as Advance Pricing Agreement (APA), Specified Domestic Transaction, Expansion of TPO Power etc. Guidance has been introduced with regard to how the accountant should exercise due diligence while inspecting international transactions in view of the increased scope of the definition of International Transactions.

The legal, Financial and accounting aspects relating transfer pricing are highly complex and have global ramifications.

" Preface to the Third Edition In the era of globalization, when multinational Enterprises (MNEs) have branches, divisions, subsidiaries and offices operating across the globe; it is common for them to transact goods and services from one jurisdiction to an associated enterprise in another tax jurisdiction. The Finance Act, 2012 has made significant changes such as Advance Pricing Agreement (APA), expansion of Transfer Pricing Officer’s (TPO’s) Power, amendments relating to penalties, etc. Also, the Finance Act, 2012 introduced a new section 92BA in the Income-tax Act. Such provisions deal with the meaning of Specified Domestic Transaction. The proposed new section 92BA provides the meaning of ""specified domestic transaction"" with reference to which the income is computed under section 92 having regard to the arm’s length price. The members of our profession are expected to do the examination of the information and documentation so maintained and expresses an opinion thereof in Form No.3CEB as to the compliance of the legal requirements. The report also requires opinion to be expressed about the truth and correctness of the particulars given in the annexure to Form No. 3CEB. Therefore, urgent need to update the publication was widely felt. I am happy to state that CA. Dhinal Shah readily accepted our request to revise the edition and who has been actively supported by CA. Vijay Iyer, Mr. Ashwin Vishwanathan, CA. Nehal Sheth and CA. Pradeep A. I place on record our sincere appreciation of the contribution made by each of them. I thank CA. Manoj Pardarsani, for carrying out thorough vetting process and who has been supported by CA. Esha Tuteja. I thank CA. Sanjay Agarwal, Chairman, Direct Taxes Committee and its Committee members for immense support provided by them.

" Foreword to the Second Edition The first edition of the Guidance Note on Report on International Transactions under section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Transfer Pricing) was published in the year 2002. Subsequent Finance Acts made some significant amendments to the law relating to transfer pricing. The globalization of the Indian economy has resulted in considerable increase in foreign institutional investments, a huge expansion in the production and service base and also a multiplicity of international transactions. As a result of this development international taxation is assuming great importance. The subject of international transaction covers a wide spectrum like cross border transactions, e-commerce, Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, transfer pricing etc. Members of the Institute are more and more required to deal with many issues related to transfer pricing. Since the law relating to transfer pricing is in the process of development, several new issues would naturally arise during the implementation of the requirements of the legislation. Further, this branch of law is relatively new to the Income-tax Act and it would take some time before the law gets settled down. During the course of about five years the members have gained experience in dealing with the requirements of the law and the rules relating to transfer pricing. It was thought fit that these insights could be incorporated in the guidance note for the benefit of our members. The Fiscal Laws Committee of the Institute constituted Study Groups in Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore to analyse all the practical issues in-depth and bring out the revised edition of the Guidance Note. I compliment the Chairman, Fiscal Laws Committee CA. G. Ramaswamy for his initiatives in getting the Guidance Note revised. I also record my appreciation for CA. Padam Chand Khincha, Convenor of the Bangalore Study Group, CA. R. Bupathy, Convenor of the Chennai Study Group and CA. Vijay Iyer, Convenor of the Delhi Study Group for their sincere efforts in bringing out this Guidance Note. Date: 3.2.2008 Sunil Talati Place: New Delhi President"

" Preface to the Second Edition Following the enactment of sections 92A to 92F in the Income-tax Act, 1961 providing for the computation of income from an international transaction having regard to arm’s length price, by the Finance Act, 2001, some significant amendments were made by the subsequent Finance Acts. These amendments were made to address the issues arising out of the practical implementation of the transfer pricing regulations. The law relating to transfer pricing is in the process of evolution and the members of the Institute are getting acquainted with the practical implications of the law and the rules relating to transfer pricing. Out of their practical experience some important issues relating to determination of arm’s length price, responsibilities of the Assessing Officer to determine the total income of the assessee in conformity with the arm’s length price determined by the Transfer Pricing Officer and maintenance and keeping of information and documents relating to international transactions have arisen. The Fiscal Laws Committee thought it fit to consider the above developments in their proper prospective and incorporate them in the revised edition of the Guidance Note. Accordingly, Study Groups were constituted in Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore under the Convenorship of CA. Vijay Iyer, CA. R. Bupathy and CA. Padam Chand Khincha respectively. The Study Groups considered the matter in-depth and came out with their valuable inputs. I must compliment CA. K. K. Chythanya, CA. Murali Mohan, CA. Nitin Garg, CA. Shikha Gupta and CA. Tarun Arora, for their excellent contributions in the preparation of this Guidance Note. I express my gratitude to CA. Sunil Talati, President and CA.

" Foreword to the First Edition The Finance Act, 2001 has introduced sections 92 to 92F in the Income-tax Act, 1961 with effect from Assessment Year 2002-2003. These provisions are commonly referred to as transfer pricing regulations. Such provisions deal with the methods of computation of income from international transactions, the documentation to be maintained by the enterprises, certification by a chartered accountant and penalty for non-compliance thereof. Every person who has entered into an international transaction during a previous year shall obtain a report from a chartered accountant and furnish such report on or before the specified date in the prescribed form. The legal, financial and accounting aspects relating to transfer pricing are highly complex and have global ramifications. It is indeed a matter of honour to chartered accountants who have been given the onerous responsibility of reporting on international transactions. I am sure that the members will discharge this responsibility to the satisfaction of the government. The Fiscal Laws Committee has closely involved itself with transfer pricing right from the stage of drafting of transfer pricing rules. It has constituted study groups in Delhi and Bangalore, got the issues closely examined and brought out this guidance note. I record my appreciation for the initiatives taken by the Fiscal Laws Committee and more particularly I thank Mr. T.N. Manoharan, Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Ved Jain, Convenor of the Delhi Study Group and Mr. Padam Chand Khincha, Convenor of the Bangalore Study Group for their excellent efforts in bringing out this guidance note. I also appreciate Mr. R. Devarajan, Secretary, Fiscal Laws Committee for his coordination of the project. Place: New Delhi Ashok Chandak Date: 2.4.2002 President"

" Clarification Regarding Authority Attached to the Documents Issued  by the Institute ""Guidance Notes' are primarily designed to provide guidance to members on matters which may arise in the course of their professional work and on which they may desire assistance in resolving issues which may pose difficulty. Guidance Notes are recommendatory in nature. A member should ordinarily follow recommendations in a guidance note relating to an auditing matter except where he is satisfied that in the circumstances of the case, it may not be necessary to do so. Similarly, while discharging his attest function, a member should examine whether the recommendations in a guidance note relating to an accounting matter have been followed or not. If the same have not been followed, the member should consider whether keeping in view the circumstances of the case, a disclosure in his report is necessary"". (Volume I of the Handbook of Auditing Pronouncements - Compendium of Standards and Statements (4th Edition, 2007), page I - 5, Para 5)"
"Chapter 1 Introduction Legislative Framework 1.1 In an era of liberalization and globalization of trade and investment and the emergence of digital economy, the perceptible results have been - increase in the number of cross-border transactions and the complexity and speed with which global business can be transacted. 1.2 When transactions are entered into between independent enterprises, the consideration therefore is determined by market forces. However, when associated enterprises deal with each other, it is possible that the commercial and financial aspects of the transactions are not influenced by external market forces but are determined based on internal factors. In such a situation, when the transfer price agreed between the associated enterprises does not reflect market forces and the arm’s length principle, the profit arising from the transactions, the consequent tax liabilities of the associated enterprises and the tax revenue of the host countries could be distorted. 1.3 The existence of different tax rates and rules in different countries offers a potential incentive to multinational enterprises to manipulate their transfer prices to recognise lower profit in countries with higher tax rates and vice versa. This can reduce the aggregate tax payable by the multinational groups and increase the after tax returns available for distribution to shareholders. 1.4 In India, the Act for a long time did not deal with this problem in a detailed manner. The erstwhile section 92 sought to determine the amount of profits which may reasonably be deemed to have been derived from a business carried on between a resident and a non-resident which, owing to the close connection between them is so arranged that it produced, to the resident, either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in that business in case the transaction would have been entered into between two entities having no close connection. Besides, sections 40A(2); 80IA(10) and 80IB(13) of the Act provide powers to the Assessing Officer to interfere with the pricing or costing of certain transactions in certain cases in order to determine the correct quantum of deduction permissible."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  2 1.5 The Finance Act, 2001, recognised that international transactions between Associated Enterprises may not be subject to the same market forces that shape relations between two independent firms, and therefore introduced a set of provisions in Chapter X of the Act under the title ""Special Provisions relating to avoidance of tax”. The statutory framework attempts to monitor transfer prices for goods, facilities and services in order to determine that they confirm to the “arm’s length principle”. Not only has section 92 of the Act been completely recast but new sections 92A to 92F have also been introduced to meet the desired objective of ensuring that the local tax base of a taxpayer is fair. 1.6 The relevant provisions contained in Chapter X (sections 92 to 92F) of the Act and the provisions dealing with the levy of penalties for non-compliance thereof are reproduced in Annexure I. The Finance Act, 2002 made certain changes to the provisions contained in sections 92A, 92C, 92F and 271F. The Finance Act, 2006 further amended section 92C. Further, the Finance Act, 2007 inserted sub-sections (3A) and (4) in section 92CA. Finance Act 2009 amended the proviso to section 92C, provided for constitution of the dispute resolution panel and empowered the Board to formulate safe harbour rules. Finance Act 2011 amended the allowable variation as per second proviso to section 92C(2) to be notified by the Central Government, and made changes to Section 92CA. The Finance Act 2012 has introduced significant amendments including inter alia clarifying the coverage of the term ‘international transactions’, expanding the scope of transfer pricing provisions to specified domestic transactions (Section 92BA) and providing an Advance Pricing Agreement framework (Section 92CC and Section 92CD) empowering the transfer pricing officer to determine arm’s length price of an international transaction noticed during the course of proceedings before him, even if the said transaction has not been referred by the Assessing Officer, provided such transaction has not been reported by taxpayer as per requirement of Section 92E of the Income Tax Act, 1961 [Section 92CA(2B)] and expanding the scope of penalties and amending Section 147 of the Act to provide that non-reporting of transaction in report as per Section 92E would be deemed to be case of escapement of income. Further, changes specifically in respect of arm’s length price determination were introduced vide Finance (No. 2) Act 2014 and the Finance Act 2015. The Finance Bill 2014 introduced the use of multiple year data and the Finance Act (No. 2), 2014 introduced range concept for determination of arm’s length price and roll-back mechanism for APA. The final rules in"
"Introduction 3 relation to the range concept and use of multiple year data were notified by the Central Board of Direct Taxes in October, 2015. 1.7 Further, section 92B extended application of transfer pricing provisions to transaction entered by an Indian entity with a resident independent third party under specified circumstances. The Finance Act 2015 increased the threshold limit for the applicability of specified domestic transaction from INR 5 crores to INR 20 crores with effect from Financial Year 2015-16. 1.8 The Finance Act 2016, in line with recommendations of the BEPS Action Plan 13, inserted section 286 for furnishing of country-by-country report and inserted proviso to section 92D(1) for maintenance of Master File, with effect from Financial Year 2016-17. Further, relevant rules and forms for country-by-country and Master File were notified on 31 October, 2017. 1.9 Further, the existing penalty provisions have been rationalised along with insertion of additional penalties for non-furnishing/ maintenance of country-by-country report and Master File. 1.10 The Finance Act 2017, amended the applicability of specified domestic transactions compliance by excluding expenditure made to person referred to in Sec. 40A(2)(b) of the Act, from the ambit of the definition. 1.11  Provisions regarding secondary adjustments and limitation on interest deduction were introduced and inserted as new sections (92CE and 94B respectively) vide Finance Act, 2017.Finance Act 2017 also introduced section 271J for levying penalty on accountants for furnishing incorrect information in reports or certificates furnished under any provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder. 1.12 The Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 made amendments to section 92CD, 92CE, 92D and 286 of the Act. These amendments are as follows:  Section 92CD (3) was amended to clarify that in cases where assessment or reassessment has already been completed and modified return of income has been filed by the tax payer under sub-section (1) of section 92CD, the Assessing Officers shall pass an order modifying the total income of the relevant assessment year determined in such assessment or reassessment, having regard to and in accordance with the APA. This amendment is applicable from 1 September, 2019. Section 92CE was amended to give clarification with regard to applicability of provision of secondary adjustment and to give an"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  4 option to assessee to make one-time payment (discussed in detail at Para 1.27 of this chapter)  Section 286 of the Act was amended to give clarification regarding definition of the “accounting year” so as to provide that the accounting year in case of the alternate reporting entity (‘ARE’) of an international group, the parent entity of which is not resident in India, shall be the one applicable to the parent entity of ARE. The said amendment will take effect retrospectively from the 1st April, 2017 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2017-18 and subsequent assessment years. 1.13 The Finance Act, 2020 made certain amendments to sections 92CB, 92CC, 92F and 94B. These amendments are as follows:  Section 92CB and 92CC of the Act was amended to include attribution of profits to the PE of a non-resident under clause (i) of sub-section (1) of section 9 of the Act. Section 92F of the Act amended the definition of term “specified date” to mean the date one month prior to the due date for furnishing the return of income under sub-section (1) of section 139 for the relevant assessment year. Section 94B of the Act was amended to exclude interest paid or payable in respect of a debt issued by a lender which is a permanent establishment in India of a non-resident, being a person engaged in the business of banking.

It intends to: (i) assist in understanding the respective responsibilities of the taxpayer enterprise and the accountant; (ii) guide the accountant as to the nature and scope of information to be obtained by him from the taxpayer enterprise to enable him to conduct the examination; (iii) provide guidance on the verification procedures to be adopted by the accountant for giving the report and the prescribed particulars in the annexure thereto; and (iv) explain the circumstances where a disclosure or qualification or disclaimer may be required from the accountant while giving his report. Applicability of the provisions 1.19 The provisions contained in Chapter X of the Act are applicable to an international transaction entered into between two or more AEs either or both of whom are non-residents. Also, in the case of a specified domestic transaction, not being an international transaction as covered as per section 92BA of the Act these provisions are attracted. 1.20 International transaction covers transaction in the nature of purchase, sale or lease of tangible or intangible property or provision of services or lending or borrowing money or any other transaction having a bearing on the profits and income, losses or assets of such enterprises and includes a mutual agreement or arrangement between two or more AEs for the allocation or apportionment of, or any contribution to, any cost or expense  1 The provisions relating to Specified Domestic Transactions are applicable with effect from assessment year 2013-14."

Further, the expression ‘international transaction’ has been clarified vide Finance Act 2012 with retrospective effect from 1 April 2002 to include a wide variety of arrangements. 1.21 According to section 92B(2) of the Act, a transaction entered into by an enterprise with a person other than an AE, shall be deemed to be a transaction between two AEs if there exists a prior agreement in relation to the relevant transaction between such other person and the AE or the terms of the relevant transaction are determined in substance between such other person and the AE. Consequently the provisions of this chapter shall apply even in the aforementioned cases. This provision has been further amended to include transactions irrespective of whether such unrelated person is a resident or non-resident, as long as either the enterprise or the AE is non-resident. 1.22 As per section 92(3), these provisions are not intended to be applied in cases where the effect of application of these provisions reduces income chargeable to tax in India or increases the loss, as the case may be. 1.23 Safe Harbour (Section 92CB of the Act) The Finance Act 2009 empowered the Board to frame safe harbour rules. Safe harbour means circumstances in which the tax authorities shall accept the transfer price as declared by the taxpayer. The safe harbour rules (‘SHR’) were notified in September 2013. In the rules, safe harbour rates were prescribed for specific nature of international transactions. The CBDT, vide a notification dated 7 June 2017, revised the existing SHRs in India. The revised SHRs apply for Assessment Year (AY) 2017-18 and two immediately following AYs i.e. upto AY 2019-20. The earlier SHRs were applicable from AY 2013-14 and four immediately following AYs i.e. upto AY 2017-18. For AY 2017-18, the taxpayer can choose from old or new rules whichever is more beneficial. CBDT by way of notification dated May 20, 2020 has extended provisions of safe harbour rules to AYs 2020-21 and 2021-22 (Substituted for ""assessment years 2020-21 and 2021-22"" by the Income-tax (Eighteenth Amendment) Rules, 2022) as well."
"Introduction 11 1.24 Key highlights Rationalisation of safe harbour rates -The safe harbour rates for all contract services have been moderated. Upper turnover threshold of INR 200 crore introduced for all contract service providers [Software Development, (ITeS), KPO, R&D for IT and generic pharmaceutical drugs]. Introduction of safe harbour for receipt of low value adding intra group services- The safe harbour provisions have been extended to receipt of such services by Indian entities under the revised SHRs. The revised SHRs in this regard also lay down a requirement for the applicant to get the method of cost pooling, exclusion of shareholder costs and duplicate costs from cost pool and the reasonableness of the allocation keys used for allocation of costs certified by an accountant. In this regard, the definition of an accountant has also been incorporated in the revised SHRs. Introduction of safe harbour rates on loans advanced in foreign currency - The revised SHRs have prescribed safe harbour rates based on London Inter-bank Offer Rate (LIBOR) for loans advanced to AEs denominated in foreign currency and based on State Bank of India’s marginal cost of funds lending rate for loans advanced to AEs denominated in INR. The revised SHRs have also prescribed staggered rates (spread over the applicable base rates) depending upon the credit rating of the overseas borrower, subject to such credit ratings being approved by CRISIL (formerly Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited)  1.25 The Safe harbour rates as per the old and new rules are tabulated below:"

"Introduction 19 1.26 APA (Section 92CC of the Act): Finance Act 2012 introduced APAs wherein the Board, with the approval of the Central Government may enter into APAs with any person to determine the ALP or specify the manner in which the ALP is to be determined, in relation to an international transaction to be entered into by that person. The scope is enhanced by Finance Act, 2020 to include income referred to in clause (i) of sub-section (1) of section 9. APAs presents a proactive measure for resolving transfer pricing disputes in a cooperative manner. The Indian APA regulations, in short, provide for the following: (a) Unilateral / bi-lateral/ multilateral APAs - Unilateral APA is an arrangement between the taxpayer and the Indian tax administration (CBDT) whilst a bilateral / multilateral APA involves not only the taxpayer and the Indian tax administration but also the taxpayer’s affiliates (with whom he transacts) and  their tax administration. (b) APA would be applicable for existing as well as new transactions. For an existing transaction, the taxpayer seeking an APA needs to file its application before the commencement of the fiscal year for which it seeks to apply. (c) The provision to provide for a roll back mechanism was brought into the Act vide Finance Act (No. 2) 2014, with effect from 1 October 2014. The Board has announced detailed rules explaining the roll back provisions and the procedure for giving effect to them. The roll back is available for 4 previous years. (d) There are procedures in place for renewal, amendments, withdrawals and revisions of APA. 1.27 Roll-back provisions The roll back provision was brought into the Act vide Finance (No. 2) Act 2014, with effect from 1 October, 2014. The Board has announced detailed rules explaining the roll back provisions and the procedure for giving effect to them. Apart from that, the Board has made another key amendment, wherein pre-filing consultation has been made optional for the taxpayer. Roll back is available for four previous years, preceding the first previous year covered in the APA. Further:  Application requesting for roll back should be made in Form 3CEDA for the relevant roll back years."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  20  International transactions covered under roll back should be same as covered in the APA. Return of income of the applicant for roll back year ought to be  furnished on or before the due date for filing return. Accountant’s Report in Form 3CEB for the roll back years should have been filed on or before the due date. Roll back application should cover all the roll back years (i.e., the years falling with the block of four years) in which the international transaction has taken place. Roll back provisions shall not be provided, in respect of an international transaction, if the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal has passed an order disposing off an appeal relating to determination of ALP of the international transaction, at any time before signing of the APA agreement; or application of roll back has the effect of reducing total income or increasing the total loss.  The manner of determining ALP in the roll back years with respect to any particular international transaction will be same as the manner agreed in the regular APA. 1.28 Annual Compliance Report (‘ACR’) and ACR Audit (Rule 10O and 10P)  Once the APA is entered into, the assesse is required to furnish ACR to Director General of Income-tax (International Taxation) for each year covered in the APA. The ACR is required to be furnished in quadruplicate in Form 3CEF for each year covered in the APA within  30 days from the due date of filing return of income for that year or within 90 days of entering into an APA whichever is later. Director General of Income-tax (International Taxation) would send one copy of ACR to competent authority of India, one copy to Commissioner of Income-tax who has jurisdiction over the income-tax assessment of the assesse and one copy to the Transfer Pricing Officer having jurisdiction over the assesse  Transfer Pricing Officer would carry out compliance audit for each year covered in the APA and shall furnish his compliance audit report to Director General of Income-tax (International Taxation) in case of unilateral APA and to the competent authority in case of bilateral or"
"Introduction 21 multilateral APA within 6 months from end of the month in which ACR is received by Transfer pricing Officer from Director General of Income-tax (International Taxation)    Regular transfer pricing assessment of transactions covered under APA would not be undertaken by the Transfer Pricing Officer   CBDT released its Third Report (2018-19)on APA in November 2019 (available at https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Lists/Latest%20News/Attachments/360/FINAL_ANNUAL_REPORT_29_11_19.pdf). As per the report a total of 944 unilateral and 211 Bilateral APA were filed till date out of which 271 (i.e. 240 unilateral and 31 bilateral) agreements were signed with the taxpayer while remaining were in process. The agreement signed covered diverse nature of transactions including Provision of Software Development Services, Provision of IT enabled Services, Receipt of Intra-group Services, Provision of Sales /after Sales Support Services, Payment of Guarantee Fee and Merchanting Trade. In majority of cases Transactional Net Margin Method was followed, while there are a few cases where Profit Split Method was followed. Further as per the Press release dated 31st March 2022, 62 APAs were signed in 2021-22, 31 APAs were signed in the year 2020-21 and 57 APAs were signed in 2019-20.

These rules are applicable to international transactions and specified domestic transactions that are entered into by taxpayers on or after 1 April, 2014. Rule 10CA contains illustrations of application of the arm’s length range concept. Multiple year data  Multiple year data (of the comparable companies for the purpose of comparability analysis) is applicable only in cases where Resale Price Method (RPM), Cost Plus Method (CPM) or Transactional Net"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  22 Margin Method (TNMM) has been selected as the Most Appropriate Method.  Thus, in cases where CUP, PSM or Other Method are selected as the Most Appropriate Method, multiple year data of comparable companies cannot be used.  For each comparable selected (under RPM, CPM or TNMM), the data of the current year is required to be considered. In case such data is not available at the time of furnishing the return of income, data pertaining to upto two preceding financial years may be used. To illustrate, say if the current year is Year zero and the financial year preceding that is Year 1 and the year prior to such year is Year 2, then it is worth noting that the rules do not envisage a situation wherein a comparable is selected only if it has data relating to Year 2.  If a comparable is selected on the basis of preceding year data (say Year 1 and Year 2), but is not found to be comparable for the current year (Year 0) for qualitative or quantitative reasons, then such comparable would need to be rejected from the data set.  When using multiple year data, data for each comparable shall be the weighted average of the selected years. An illustration explaining the computation is provided below:  Year 0 Year 1 Year 2 Total  Operating Profit 250 300 350 900 OP/TC for the comparable would be 900/ 5400 = 16.7% Total Cost 1700 1800 1900 5400  Further, the rules provides that in the event current year data becomes available during the course of the assessment proceedings, then the same shall be used by the TPO for the purpose of the analysis. Application of range  As per the rules, the ‘range concept’ shall be applicable when: (a) the MAM is either; Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) Method, RPM, CPM, or TNMM; and (b) there are at least 6 entries in the dataset. Where these conditions are not fulfilled, ‘arithmetic mean’ shall continue to apply, as before, along with the tolerance range benefit (3% or 1%)"
"Introduction 23 For determination of the range, the margins in the data set (i.e., set of comparable companies) are required to be arranged in ascending order and the arm’s length range would be data points lying between the 35th and 65th percentile of the data set. The computation mechanism of range, is explained by way of illustrations below: Illustration 1: Where the data set comprises 7 data points (arranged in ascending order), and the percentiles computed are not whole numbers Percentile Formula Result Value to be selected 35th Total no. of data points in dataset * 35% = [7 * 35%]  2.45 3rd value* 65th Total no. of data points in dataset * 65% = [7 * 65%]  4.55 5th value* Median Total no. of data points in datasets * 50% = [7 * 0.5]  3.50 4th value* * Value referred to here is the place value in the data set as arranged in ascending order. Illustration 2: Where the data set comprises 20 data points (arranged in ascending order), and the percentiles computed are whole numbers. Percentile Formula Result Value to be selected  35th Total no. of data points in dataset*35% = [20 * 35%]  7 Mean of 7th & 8th value  65th Total no. of data points in dataset*65% = [20* 65%]  13 Mean of 13th  & 14th   value  Median Total no. of data points in datasets*50% = [20 * 0.5]  10 Mean of 10th  & 11th  value  If the transaction price falls within the range, then the same shall be deemed to be the ALP. If the transaction price falls outside the range, the ALP shall be taken to be the Median of the data set. 1.30 Three tier documentation structure The three-tiered documentation structure (applicable with effect from Financial Year 2016-17) would consist of a “Master File”, “Local File” and “Country-by-Country Report” (CbC Report). The Master File seeks to capture information regarding the taxpayer’s global operations and their transfer pricing policies. Rule 10DA prescribes information to be furnished in Master File and related rules. The Local File would capture entity-specific information with reference to the related party transactions. In the Indian"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  24 context, the existing transfer pricing documentation requirements as per Rule 10D of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 (the Rules) already encompasses the Local File requirements. The CbC Report would be applicable for large multinational enterprises (MNEs)2 and would capture key metrics of all entities in the group such as revenue, taxes paid, capital employed, headcount, etc (as defined in section 286 of the Act). Further, Rule 10DB prescribes rules relating to CbC Report. 1.31 Secondary adjustment Secondary adjustment means an adjustment in the books of accounts of the taxpayer and its associated enterprise to reflect that the actual allocation of profits between the taxpayer and its associated enterprise are consistent with the transfer price determined as a result of primary adjustment, thereby removing the imbalance between cash account and actual profit of the taxpayer. The taxpayer shall be required to carry out secondary adjustment where the primary adjustment to transfer price:  has been made suo motu by the taxpayer in his return of income; or   made by the Assessing Officer or the appellate authority3, as the case may be has been accepted by the taxpayer; or   is determined by an advance pricing agreement entered into by the taxpayer under section 92CC. Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 amended this clause to restrict the secondary adjustment provisions to only those advance pricing agreements which have been signed on or after 1 April 2017. This is a retrospective amendment meant to apply from AY 2018-19; or   is made as per the safe harbour rules framed under section 92CB; or   is arising as a result of resolution of an assessment by way of the mutual agreement procedure under an agreement entered into under section 90 or 90A. 2 Having annual consolidated group turnover of over INR 5500 Crores million in the immediately preceding financial year 3 Section 92CE of the Income Tax Act 1961 only refers to Assessing Officer but the notification No GSR 590(E) [52/2017 (F.No. 370142/12/2017-TPL)], dated 15-6-2017 refers to Appellate Authority along with the Assessing Officer. The term Appellate Authority has not been defined in the notification."
"Introduction 25 Where as a result of primary adjustment to the transfer price, there is an increase in the total income or reduction in the loss, as the case may be, of the taxpayer, the excess money which is available with its associated enterprise, if not repatriated to India within the time as prescribed (see table below), shall be deemed to be an advance made by the taxpayer to such associated enterprise and the interest on such advance, shall be computed as the income of the taxpayer, in the manner as prescribed4 below.

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  26 Type of primary adjustment Time limit for repatriation Applicable interest rate for delayed receipts Transaction in INR Transaction in foreign currency due date of filing of return for the relevant previous year (b) from the end of the month in which the APA has been entered into if the said agreement has been entered into after the due date of filing of return for the relevant previous year. Adjustment pursuant to MAP On or before ninety days from the date of giving effect by the Assessing Officer under rule 44H to the resolution arrived at under MAP   Excess money means the difference between the arm’s length price determined in primary adjustment and the price at which the international transaction has actually been undertaken. Primary adjustment to a transfer price means the determination of transfer price in accordance with the arm’s length principle resulting in an increase in the total income or reduction in the loss, as the case may be, of the taxpayer."
"Introduction 27 Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 further amends section 92CE to:  enable Assessee to repatriate excess money from any of the Associated enterprises of the Assessee which is not resident in India; and  provide an option to Assessee to pay additional income-tax at the rate of 18% on such excess money or part thereof which is not repatriated to India, instead of treating it as deemed advance made by the taxpayer to such associated enterprise and calculating the interest income on such advance, as discussed in above table. Secondary adjustment would not be applicable, if (i) the amount of primary adjustment made in the case of a taxpayer in any previous year does not exceed one crore rupees and (ii) the primary adjustment is made in respect of an assessment year commencing on or before 1 April2016.5  5Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019, has made it clear that the two conditions relating to applicability of secondary adjustment are alternate conditions by replacing the word “and” with an “or”. Further this amendment is retrospective from assessment year 2018-19"
"Chapter 2 Responsibility of an Enterprise and the Accountant Responsibility of an Enterprise 2.1 Section 92D provides that every person who has entered into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction, during a previous year, shall keep and maintain such information and documents, prescribed by the Board, as will assist the Assessing Officer/ Transfer Pricing Officer to compute the income arising from that transaction, having regard to the ALP. 2.1.1. Rule 10D prescribes the information and documents required to be kept and maintained under section 92D ie, Local File. Further Rule 10DA prescribes information and document to be kept and maintained under proviso to sub-section (1) of section 92D ie, Master File. Master file needs to be submitted to the prescribed authority on or before the due date for furnishing the return of income as specified under sub-section (1) of section 139. 2.1.2. Section 286 provides that every parent entity or alternate reporting entity (designated by parent) of an international group that is resident in India, shall for every reporting accounting year, furnish a report in the form and manner as may be prescribed, within the due date provided in Rule 10DB(4). In case of a constituent entity resident in India, the parent of which is not resident in India, such entity shall notify whether it is the alternate reporting entity of the international group or the details of the parent entity/ alternate reporting entity and the country of which such entities are resident. Further, Rule 10DB prescribes rules relating to furnishing of CbC Report. 2.2 This responsibility of an enterprise to keep and maintain prescribed documents arises because of its unique position of being in control and custody of information that is necessary to verify whether the international transaction or specified domestic transaction to which it was party was carried out on the arm’s length principle. 2.3 OECD in Transfer Pricing Guidelines, 2017 asserts the three main objectives of maintaining transfer pricing documentation:"
"Responsibility of an Enterprise and the Accountant  29 “1. To ensure that taxpayers give appropriate consideration to transfer pricing requirements in establishing prices and other conditions for transactions between associated enterprises and in reporting the income derived from such transactions in their tax returns; 2. to provide tax administrations with the information necessary to conduct an informed transfer pricing risk assessment; and 3. to provide tax administrations with useful information to employ in conducting an appropriately thorough audit of the transfer pricing practices of entities subject to tax in their jurisdiction, although it may be necessary to supplement the documentation with additional information as the audit progresses.” 2.4 The requirement to keep and maintain such information and documents as prescribed in Rule 10D ie, Local File with respect to an international transaction has, however, been waived in the case of those persons who have entered into international transactions the aggregate value of which, as recorded in the books of account, does not exceed one crore rupees - Rule 10D(2). 2.5 Persons who are so exempted from the mandatory requirement of keeping and maintaining information and documents prescribed as per Rule 10D shall, nevertheless, on the basis of the material in their possession, have to substantiate that the income on the international transactions entered into by them has been computed in accordance with the provisions of section 92 -proviso to Rule 10D(2). 2.6 By virtue of sub-section (2) of section 92D, the Board is empowered to prescribe the period for which the assessee must maintain the prescribed information and records. Pursuant thereto, the Board has stipulated that the prescribed information and documents prescribed as per Rule 10D (ie, Local File) and Rule 10DA (ie, Master File) be kept and maintained for a period of eight years from the end of the relevant assessment year - Rule 10D(5) and Rule 10DA(7). For example: For Financial Year 2018-19, an Assessee has to maintain prescribed information and documents for 8 years from the end of the relevant assessment year (2019-20), i.e. until Financial Year 2028-29. 2.7 Under section 92D (3), the Assessing Officer or the Commissioner (Appeals) during the course of any proceeding under the Act may require a person who has entered into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction to furnish any information or document, which he was expected to maintain under section 92D (1). The person shall furnish the"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 30 information or document called for within thirty days from the date of receipt of a notice issued in this regard. 2.8 Where, for any reason, the person is unable to produce the required information or documents within the stipulated period of thirty days, the Assessing Officer or Commissioner (Appeals) may, on an application made by the person, extend the period by a further period or periods not exceeding, in all, thirty days. 2.9 Under section 92E, every person who has entered into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction during a previous year shall obtain a report from an accountant and furnish such report on or before the specified date in the prescribed form duly signed and verified in the prescribed manner by such accountant and setting forth such particulars as may be prescribed. ""Specified date"" means the date one month prior to the due date for furnishing the return of income under sub-section (1) of section 139 for the relevant assessment year. The above-mentioned Explanation reads as under: “In case of an assessee who is required to furnish a report referred to in section 92E, the due date means the 31st day of October of the assessment year.”  Accountant’s responsibility 2.10 The term “accountant” has been defined in clause (i) of section 92F as under: “accountant” shall have the same meaning as in the Explanation below sub-section (2) of section 288. The above-mentioned Explanation reads as under: ""accountant"" means a chartered accountant as defined in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 (38 of 1949) who holds a valid certificate of practice under sub-section (1) of section 6 of that Act, but does not include [except for the purposes of representing the assessee under sub-section (1)]— (a)  in case of an assessee, being a company, the person who is not eligible for appointment as an auditor of the said company in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 141 of the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013); or"

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 32 (ix)  a person who has been convicted by a court of an offence involving fraud and a period of ten years has not elapsed from the date of such conviction. 2.10.1 Therefore, the meaning of ""accountant"" now applies for the definition of an ""Authorised Representative"" under section 288(2). As a result, in order to be appointed as an Authorised Representative for an assessee for any proceedings under the Act, a Chartered Accountant must have a certificate of practice. However, a Chartered Accountant having any other qualification specified in section 288 may be appointed as an Authorised Representative. 2.10.2 Therefore, after this amendment, a Chartered Accountant who does not satisfy both the following conditions cannot be appointed as an Authorised Representative for an assessee: • He/she does not have a certificate of practice; and • He/she does not have any other specified qualification. 2.11 Though the section refers to the accounts being examined by an accountant, which means a chartered accountant as defined above, the examination can also be done by a firm of chartered accountants. This has been a recognised practice under the Act. In such a case, it would be necessary to state the name of the partner who has signed the report on behalf of the firm. The accountant signing the report as a partner of a firm or in his individual capacity should give his membership number below his name. 2.12 As per the decision taken by the Council of the ICAI, all attest functions undertaken by the members have to bear a UDIN issued by the ICAI. The same needs to be mentioned on the document being signed/ attested by the member. 2.13 Section 92E does not stipulate that only the statutory auditor appointed under the Companies Act or other similar statute should perform the examination. The examination can, therefore, be conducted either by the statutory auditor or by any other chartered accountant in practice having certificate of practice. 2.14 The issue of a report under section 92E, being a recurring assignment for expressing a professional opinion, the accountant accepting the assignment should communicate with the accountant who had done the examination in the earlier year, as provided in the Chartered Accountants Act. In the case of a person whose accounts of the business or profession have been audited under any other law (i.e. a company, a co-operative"
"Responsibility of an Enterprise and the Accountant  33 society, etc. which is required to get the accounts audited under a Statute), it is not necessary to communicate with the statutory auditor if he had not done the examination in the earlier year. Attention of the members is invited to the detailed discussion in the publication of ICAI, “Code of Ethics” under clause (8) of Part I of the First Schedule to the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 vide Annexure V. 2.15 The accountant should obtain from the assessee a letter of appointment for conducting the examination as mentioned in section 92E. It is advisable that such an appointment letter should be signed by the person competent to sign/verify the return of income in terms of the provisions of section 140 or by any person who has been authorized by the company to make such an appointment. The accountant should get the statement of particulars, as required in the annexure to the report, authenticated by the assessee before he proceeds to verify the same. The accountant is required to submit his report to the person appointing him viz. the assessee. 2.16 The appointment of the accountant in the case of a company need not be made at the general meeting of the members. It can be made by the Board of Directors or even by any officer, if so authorised by the Board in this behalf. The appointment in the case of a firm or a proprietary concern can be made by a partner or the proprietor or a person authorised by the assessee. It is possible for the assessee to appoint two or more chartered accountants for carrying out the examination, in which case, the report will have to be signed by all the chartered accountants. In case of disagreement, they can give their reports separately. In this regard, attention is invited to SA – 299(Revised) Joint Audit of Financial Statements, wherein the principle is laid down as under: The joint auditors are required to issue common audit report, however, where the joint auditors are in disagreement with regard to the opinion or any matters to be covered by the audit report, they shall express their opinion in a separate audit report. A joint auditor is not bound by the views of the majority of the joint auditors regarding the opinion or matters to be covered in the audit report and shall express opinion formed by the said joint auditor in separate audit report in case of disagreement. In such circumstances, the audit report(s) issued by the joint auditor(s) shall make a reference to the separate audit report(s) issued by the other joint auditor(s). Further, separate audit report shall also make reference to the audit report issued by other joint auditors. Such reference shall be made under the heading “Other Matter Paragraph” as per SA 706(Revised), “Emphasis of Matter Paragraphs and Other Matter Paragraphs in the Independent Auditor’s Report”."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 34 The same analogy shall apply to the report to be given under section 92E. 2.17 The Act prohibits a relative or an employee of the assessee being appointed as an accountant under section 92E. Also, as per a decision of the Council (reported in the Code of Ethics under clause (4) of Part I of Second Schedule), a chartered accountant who is in employment of a concern or in any other concern under the same management cannot be appointed as an auditor of that concern. Therefore, an employee of an assessee or an employee of a concern under the same management cannot examine the accounts and records of an assessee under section 92E. 2.18 An accountant responsible for writing or the maintenance of the books of account of the assessee should not examine such accounts. This principle will apply to the partner of such an accountant as well as to the firm in which he is a partner. In view of this, an accountant who is responsible for writing or the maintenance of the books of account, his partner or the firm in which he is a partner should not accept the examination assignment under section 92E in the case of such an assessee. 2.19 In view of the Explanation 2 of section 288 of the Income tax Act, 1961 and provision of Code of Ethics (Revised 2020), an internal auditor of the assessee cannot conduct the examination under section 92E of the Income Tax Act, 1961 whether or not he is an employee of the company. However, an accountant or a firm of accountants appointed as tax consultants of the assessee can conduct the examination under section 92E. 2.20 No separate guidelines have been prescribed for fees under section 92E. The Institute has recommended fees for professional services on the basis of time devoted by the accountant and his assistants. The scale of fees recommended by the Committee for Capacity Building of CA firms and Small & Medium Practitioners for professional assignment is given in Annexure VI. The Council has also clarified that the scale does not include fees chargeable in respect of non-qualified assistants and that the chartered accountants are free to negotiate the terms in respect of such assistants with the clients. 2.21 It will be appreciated that no uniform fees can be recommended for the reporting function exercised under section 92E of the Act. The accountant should charge fees depending upon the responsibility involved and taking into consideration the work involved in such examination. It is necessary that members of the profession should also maintain reasonable standards of professional fees."
"Responsibility of an Enterprise and the Accountant  35 2.22 A question may arise whether an accountant appointed under section 92E can be held responsible if he does not complete the examination and give his report before the specified date. The answer to this question will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. Normally, it is the professional duty of a chartered accountant to ensure that the examination accepted by him is completed before the due date. If there is any unreasonable delay on his part, he is answerable to the Institute if a complaint is made by the client. However, if the delay in the completion of examination is attributable to his client, the accountant cannot be held responsible. In view of the fact that the Act does not give any discretion to the tax authorities to extend the time limit for furnishing of the report, the examination has to be completed within the time limit provided in the Act. It is, therefore, necessary that a chartered accountant should not accept assignments which he cannot complete within the specified date. 2.23 In the case of an examination, the accountant is required to express his opinion as to whether the assessee has maintained the proper information and documents, as prescribed, in respect of the international transactions entered into by him. As regards the statement of particulars to be annexed to the report, he is required to give his opinion as to whether the particulars are true and correct. In giving his report the accountant will have to use his professional skill and expertise and apply such tests as the circumstances of the case may require, considering the contents of the report. 2.24 Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 gives certain powers to the auditors to call for the books of account, information, documents, explanations, etc. and to have access to all books and records whether kept at the registered office of the Company or at any other place. The accountant is advised to obtain all the books of accounts, information, documents, explanation etc. from the enterprise to enable him to discharge his responsibility under the Act in a satisfactory manner. If, however, the assessee does not produce any particular record or fails to provide any specific information or explanation called for, the accountant will be required to report the same and accordingly qualify his report. 2.25 The report by the accountant given under section 92E sets forth such particulars as have been prescribed in Form 3CEB. In order that the accountant may be in a position to explain any question which may arise later on, it is necessary that he should keep detailed notes about the evidence on which he has relied upon while conducting the examination and"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 36 also maintain all his working papers. Such working papers should include his notes on the following, amongst other matters: (a) work done while conducting the examination and by whom; (b) explanations and information given to him during the course of the examination and by whom; (c) decision on the various points taken; (d) the judicial pronouncements relied upon by him while making the report;  (e) certificates issued by the client (f) representation letter issued by the management of the assessee; and (g) annexure to Form No.3CEB duly filled in and authenticated by the client. 2.26 Attention is also invited to the “SA 230 - Audit Documentation” which provides that documentation should serve as a sufficient and appropriate record of the basis for the accountant’s report. Further, the documentation should be prepared on a timely basis and the accountant should document all matters which are important in providing evidence that the examination was planned and performed in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 2.27 While test checks may suffice in the conduct of a statutory audit for the expression of the accountant's opinion as to whether the accounts depict a true and fair' view, the accountant may be required to apply reasonable tests on the total information to be prepared by the assessee in respect of certain items in the prescribed form. While the entity may have to prepare the details for the entire year, the accountant may have to ensure that no items have been omitted in the information furnished and a reasonable test check would reveal whether or not the information furnished is correct. Accountant should exercise professional judgement while placing reliance on the documents, information and evidences provided by the assesse. The Accountant should take an appropriate Management Representation Letter from the assessee. 2.28 The extent of check undertaken would have to be indicated by the accountant in his working papers. The accountant is advised to design his examination programme in such a manner, which will reveal the extent of checking undertaken by the accountant and ensures that adequate documentation in maintained in support of the information being certified by him."
"Responsibility of an Enterprise and the Accountant  37 2.29 The accountant may rely upon the audit conducted by an internal auditor or by an outside professional firm appointed as internal auditor, by using his own judgement as to the degree of reliance which he wishes to place on the work of the internal auditor relevant to the examination. The degree of reliance would depend on the areas of work covered by the internal auditor and relevant for purposes of the examination, particularly by reference to working papers/documents of the internal auditor and ensuring that reasonable checks/tests have been applied to transactions covered by the internal auditor, to satisfy himself about the authenticity of the ultimate information. 2.30 It would be in the interest of the accountant to obtain and scrutinise the programme of work and procedures adopted and the relevant working papers and documents obtained by the internal auditor in evidence of the work carried out by him. Further, the accountant will have the sole responsibility for the report issued and the responsibility will not be reduced by the accountant’s use of the work of the internal auditors. Further, the accountant shall determine: (a)  Whether the work of the internal auditors is likely to be adequate for the purposes of the examination; and (b)  If so, the planned effect of the work of the internal auditors on the nature, timing or extent of the external auditor’s procedures  Reference may be made to the Standards on Auditing: Using the Work of Internal Auditors [SA 610 (Revised)] – vide Annexure VII. 2.31 Primarily, it would be necessary for the accountant to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, at the financial statement and assertion levels, through understanding the entity and its environment, including the entity’s internal control, thereby providing a basis for designing and implementing responses to the assessed risks of material misstatement. This will help him to reduce the risk of material misstatement to an acceptably low level. Reference may be made to the Standards on Auditing: SA 315 Identifying and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement through Understanding the Entity and its Environment (and SA 520, Analytical Procedures. 2.32 The accountant must ensure that he receives a standard Management Representation Letter in respect of all oral representations explicitly or implicitly given to him. The letter should indicate and document the continuing appropriateness of the representations made to him and reduce the possibility of any misunderstanding concerning the matters which"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 38 are the subject of the representations. Further, in relation to certain transactions, such as deemed international transactions, free of cost services/ goods, etc. the extent of reliance placed by the Accountant on the assessee is higher as compared to transactions such as sales/ purchase of goods, provision of services, etc. In these cases while the Accountant should exercise due professional judgement and care, the onus to identify and disclose such transactions (i.e., deemed international transactions, free of cost services/ goods, etc.) is with the assessee. Therefore in such scenario Accountant is entitled to place reliance on management representation letter issued by the assessee. However, it may be noted that in respect of matters that may be directly verified by the accountant, mere obtaining of a management representation letter will not be sufficient compliance with the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards. 2.33 If the assessee is unable to obtain relevant information in respect of the overseas branches duly certified by the overseas accountant, the relevant facts should be suitably disclosed and reported upon. 2.34 Where Accountant’s Report is issued to non-resident assessee and such non-resident is not statutorily required to maintain books of accounts in India under any law, the Accountant should place reliance on Form 26AS, invoices, agreements etc. The Accountant may also place reliance on documents, information and accounts maintained by the Indian assessee with whom the non-resident assessee has entered into international transaction(s). 2.35 Paragraph 3 of Form No. 3CEB requires the accountant to state whether the prescribed particulars are furnished in the annexure to the report and whether in his opinion and to the best of his information and according to the explanations given to him, they are true and correct. The accountant may have a difference of opinion with regard to the particulars furnished by the assessee and he has to bring these differences under various clauses in Form No.3CEB. The accountant should make a specific reference to those clauses in Form No. 3CEB in which he has expressed his reservations, difference of opinion, disclaimer etc. in this paragraph. 2.36 In case the prescribed particulars are given in part or piecemeal to the accountant or the relevant form is incomplete and the assessee does not give the information against all or any of the clauses, the accountant should not withhold the entire report. In such a case, he can qualify his report on matters in respect of which information is not furnished to him. In the absence of relevant information, the accountant would have no option but to state in his report that the relevant information has not been furnished by the"
"Responsibility of an Enterprise and the Accountant  39 assessee. As a good practice, the Accountant should provide a note detailing the rationale of Accountant. Such note should be provided along with the Accountant’s Report. 2.37 Accountant should communicate basis for each position taken to the Enterprise in writing. Professional misconduct 2.38 When any question relating to professional misconduct in connection with the examination arises, the accountant would be liable under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 and the ICAI's disciplinary jurisdiction will prevail in this regard. 2.39 Finance Act 2017 has introduced section 271J for levying penalty on accountants for furnishing incorrect information in reports or certificates furnished under any provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder. The Assessing Officer or the Commissioner (Appeals), in such cases, may direct the accountant to pay a sum of ten thousand rupees for each such report or certificate."
"Chapter 3 Associated Enterprises Associated enterprises and deemed associated enterprises The term “associated enterprise” is defined in two parts – the term “enterprise” is defined in section 92F (iii) of the Act while the term “associated enterprise” is defined in section 92A of the Act. Meaning of enterprise: The term ‘enterprise’ is defined under clause (iii) of section 92F of the Act wherein “enterprise” means a person (including a permanent establishment of such person) who is, or has been, or is proposed to be, engaged in any activity, relating to,  — the production, storage, supply, distribution, acquisition or control of articles or goods, or know-how, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licences, franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar nature, or any data, documentation, drawing or specification relating to any patent, invention, model, design, secret formula or process, of which the other enterprise is the owner or in respect of which the other enterprise has exclusive rights, or  — the provisions of services of any kind, or  — in carrying out any work in pursuance of a contract, or  — in investment, or  — providing loan or  — in the business of acquiring, holding, underwriting or dealing with shares, debentures or other securities of any other body corporate,  — whether such activity or business is carried on, directly or through one or more of its units or divisions or subsidiaries, or whether such unit or division or subsidiary is located at the same place where the enterprises is located or at a different place or places. While the term is defined to mean a person engaged in the past, present or in the future in any activity relating to tangibles, intangibles, facilities or"
"Associated Enterprises  41 services with widest possible modes, forms or pattern of operation, it also includes a permanent establishment of such person. “Permanent Establishment” referred to in clause (iii)(a) of section 92F of the Act, includes a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 3.1  Two or more enterprises can be regarded as ‘associated enterprises’ only if the provisions of section 92A are satisfied. Section 92A defines ‘associated enterprise’, wherein sub-section (1) provides a source definition, whereas, sub-section (2) provides for deeming provision which enumerates 13 situations, fulfilment of any of which at any time during the relevant previous year would deem to make the two enterprises an associated enterprises. Source definition [Section 92A(1)] 3.2  According to sub-section (1), an enterprise which participates directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, in the management or control or capital of the other enterprise shall be regarded as an associated enterprise. This can be understood as follows: Situation 1 - Direct Participation:    Situation 2 - Participation through Intermediary       In both the situations detailed above, B will be an associated enterprise of A. 3.3 Similarly, an enterprise in respect of which one or more persons who participate in its management or control or capital, directly or indirectly, or through one or more intermediaries are the same persons who participate in A Participates in management/ capital/control B A Participates in management/ capital/control B I Intermediary"

This proposition can be understood by the following diagrammatic presentation:          In the above situation, C and D are associated enterprises by virtue of A participating in the management or capital or control of both C and D.             In the above example, A and B, conjointly and simultaneously, participate in the management, capital and control of C and D. Consequently, C and D are to be construed as associated enterprises. A Participates in management,/management/ capital/ control Participates in management/ capital/control D C Participates in Management/ capital/control Participates in management/ capital/control D C I Intermediary A B"
"Associated Enterprises  43 Deemed definition of Associated Enterprise [Section 92A(2)] 3.4 The Finance Act, 2002 had amended sub-section (2) of section 92A to the effect that for the purposes of sub-section (1), two enterprises shall be deemed to be associated enterprises if, at any time during the previous year any of the conditions mentioned in clauses (a) to (m) are satisfied. The provisions of sub-section (2) of section 92A supplements the definition of associated enterprise given in sub-section (1) by enlisting various situations under which two enterprises shall be deemed to be associated enterprises. It may be noted that when Finance Act, 2002 had amended sub-section (2) of section 92A, the memorandum to the Finance Bill, 2002 explained the said amendment as under: “It is proposed to amend sub-section (2) of the said section to clarify that the mere fact of participation of one enterprise in the management or control or capital of the other enterprise or the participation of one or more persons in the management or control or capital of both the enterprises shall not make them associated enterprise unless the criteria specified in sub-section (2) are fulfilled.” Considering the above, for interpreting the AE relationship provided in sub-section (1), the situations mentioned in sub-section (2) need to be referred. In other words, sub-section (1) is dependent on situations given under sub-section (2) of section 92A. Each of these situations specified in clauses (a) to (m) of sub-section (2) of section 92A are discussed here below with suitable illustration, wherever considered necessary. It may be noted that for the purposes of these clauses, two enterprises would be associated enterprises if the conditions stipulated therein are fulfilled at any time during the previous year. Besides, in clauses (c) to (m) the words ‘directly’ or ‘indirectly’ have not been used which indicates the intention of the legislature that indirect control is not envisaged in these clauses. Therefore, direct relationship between two enterprises is relevant for the purposes of clauses (c) to (m) in order to determine whether they are associated enterprises. 3.5 One enterprise holds, directly or indirectly, shares carrying not less than twenty-six per cent of the voting power in the other enterprise. [Section 92A(2)(a)]"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 44 Two enterprises shall be associated enterprises based on the shareholding of one enterprise in the other if the investing enterprise holds shares carrying not less than twenty-six per cent of the voting power in the other enterprise. Holding for this purpose includes indirect holding too. As the terms used are “shares” and “voting power”, it is apparent that this clause applies only to those cases where the investee enterprise is a company. However, the investor enterprise need not be company and could be any person. Further, this clause uses terms “….shares carrying not less than twenty-six per cent of the voting power….”. Accordingly, it is essential that the “shares” should carry voting power. If the shareholding in the investee company does not carry any voting power (for example preference shares with no voting rights) than such shareholding should not be taken into consideration for computing threshold limit of twenty-six per cent. 3.6 Any person or enterprise holds, directly or indirectly, shares carrying not less than twenty-six per cent of the voting power in each of such enterprises. [Section 92A(2)(b)]  Under this clause, two enterprises are deemed associated enterprises, even though one enterprise may not hold any shares in the other enterprise. This clause comes into play when one person or enterprise simultaneously holds shares carrying not less than twenty-six per cent voting power in each such enterprise. Hence for this clause to apply: • both the investee enterprises have to be companies. • one person or enterprise simultaneously holds shares carrying 26% or more voting power in each of them. • Both the enterprises need not hold any shares in each other if they have common 26% or more voting right held by a company. • Shareholding may be direct or indirect. For example, if AA of UK holds 26% voting power in BB of Germany and also in CC of India, then BB and CC shall be deemed to be associated enterprises. Even for this clause, shareholding may be direct or indirect holding and shares should carry voting power."
"Associated Enterprises  45 3.7 A loan advanced by one enterprise to the other enterprise constitutes not less than fifty-one per cent of the book value of the total assets of the other enterprise. [Section 92A(2)(c)] Where the lender enterprise’s loans to the borrower enterprise constitute 51% or more of the ‘book value’ of the total assets of the borrowing enterprise, then both the lender and the borrower enterprises would be treated as ‘associated enterprises’. ‘Book value’ of assets means value of assets appearing in books of account. It is important to note that requirement is whether the loan advanced is 51% or more of the book value of total assets of the borrower enterprise and not 51% or more of the market value of assets of the borrower-enterprise. Example: Suppose Enterprise X gives a loan of $100 million to Enterprise Y on 01-04-2020. At that time, the book value of assets of enterprise B was $200 million. On 26-4-2020, enterprise Y repays $ 10 million. On 31-3-2021, due to booking of impairment losses, the book value of assets of enterprise Y is $ 180 million. At that time, loan outstanding is $ 90 million (i.e., $ 100 million minus $ 10 million repaid). Loan outstanding on book value of the assets of Y comes out 50% (90/180 x 100 = 50%), However, the requirement is to check the % of loan advanced on book value i.e., 55% (100/180 x 100 = 55%). So, in this case, X and Y will be associated enterprises. Book value of assets: The term ‘book value’ has been defined by ICAI in its Guidance Note on Terms used in Financial Statements as the amount at which an item of asset is shown in the books. The term asset is defined in the Framework for Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (hereafter referred as “the Framework”) issued by ICAI. The following are the features of an asset :  • It is a resource. • It arises out of past transactions or events. • It is controlled by the enterprise. • Future economic benefits are expected from it"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 46 Apart from the above, the following are, also, important:  • Intangible Assets: Intangible assets are assets so these must be included in book value of assets. • Accumulated Losses: The accumulated losses, shown in assets side only because they have debit balance, are not assets and will not be included in book value of assets because there is no future economic benefits. • Deferred Revenue Expenditure: The enterprise does not control the expected future economic benefits from deferred revenue expenditure. Hence, they are not assets. • All the items on asset side of balance sheet which satisfy the definition of ‘assets’ in the Framework should be taken at ‘book value’. Moreover, the book value of assets only should be taken without deducting book value of liabilities. 3.8 One enterprise guarantees not less than ten per cent of the total borrowings of the other enterprise. [Section 92A(2)(d)] Where the guarantor enterprise guarantees 10% or more of the total borrowing of the enterprise seeking guarantee, then they would become ‘associated enterprises’. Rule 10TA(c) provides the definition of term corporate guarantee. Corporate guarantee means explicit corporate guarantee extended by a company to its wholly owned subsidiary being a non-resident in respect of any short-term or long-term borrowing. Explanation.—For the purposes of Rule 10TA (c), explicit corporate guarantee does not include letter of comfort, implicit corporate guarantee, performance guarantee or any other guarantee of similar nature; It may be mentioned that as the clause does not specify the nature of guarantee, a view is possible that it includes all types of guarantees. 3.9 More than half of the board of directors or members of the governing board, or one or more executive directors or executive members of the governing board of one enterprise, are appointed by the other enterprise. [Section 92A(2)(e)]"
"Associated Enterprises  47 Where one enterprise has appointed  (a) more than one-half of the board of directors or members of the governing board; or (b) one or more executive directors or executive members of that board in another enterprise  the two enterprises shall be deemed to be associated enterprises. This clause refers to “board of directors” and “governing board”. As per section 2(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, the term “board of directors” would refer to the “collective body of directors of a company”. The term “governing board”, correspondingly, would refer to a body or council that has the executive authority to manage the affairs of the enterprise to which it relates. These enterprises could be artificial juridical non-corporate bodies. For the purposes of this clause, the appointment of even one person to the post of executive director or executive member would make the enterprises associated enterprises. It is important to note that merely having the power to appoint (50% of directors/one or more executive directors) is not enough. Actual exercise of the power is necessary to make both enterprises associated enterprises. 3.10 More than half of the directors or members of the governing board, or one or more of the executive directors or executive members of the governing board of each of the two enterprises are appointed by the same person or persons. [Section 92A(2)(f)] Clause (f) is an extension of the principle laid down in clause (e). This clause is applicable where the same person has:  (a) appointed more than one-half of the board of directors or members of the governing board; or (b) appointed one or more executive directors or executive members of the governing board of two or more enterprises or (c)  As combination of (a) and (b), same person(s) appoints one or more executive directors or executive members in one enterprise and 50% or more of the directors/ members in the other. For example, the appointment of seven out of twelve members of board of directors of B Ltd. and six out of ten members of the board of directors of C"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 48 Ltd. is controlled and has been made by A Ltd. By virtue of clause (f), B Ltd. and C Ltd. are associated enterprises. Further, if the appointment of the executive director of B Ltd. and six out of ten members of the board of directors of C Ltd. have been made by A Ltd., then B Ltd. and C Ltd. shall be regarded as associated enterprises. For the purpose of both the clauses (e) and (f) , two enterprises shall be deemed to be associated enterprises only when one of the enterprise exercises its right and actually appoints one executive director/ member to the board or more than half of the Board of directors at any time during the year. The mere right to appoint one executive director or executive member or more than half of the Board of directors by one enterprise to the Board of another enterprise, would not make both the entities as associated enterprises. 3.11 The manufacture or processing of goods or articles or business carried out by one enterprise is wholly dependent on the use of know-how, patents, copyrights, trade-marks, licences, franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar nature, or any data, documentation, drawing or specification relating to any patent, invention, model, design, secret formula or process, of which the other enterprise is the owner or in respect of which the other enterprise has exclusive rights. [Section 92A(2)(g)] Two enterprises are deemed to be associated: • if one is wholly dependent on the other • for the use of know-how, patents, copyrights etc. • for the manufacture or processing of goods or articles or business carried on by such enterprise. It should be noted that such know-how, patents, copyrights etc. must be either owned by the other enterprise or the exclusive rights thereto must vest with the other enterprise. If an Indian enterprise is wholly dependent on the licence granted by a non-resident enterprise for manufacture or processing of goods or articles or business carried out by the Indian enterprise both enterprises shall be deemed to be associated enterprises. The clause will equally be applicable in case where the overseas entity is wholly dependent on the license / brand owned by the Indian entity."
"Associated Enterprises  49 Section 92A(2)(g) applies only if the manufacture or processing of or business carried out by one enterprise is wholly dependent upon the intangible assets of the other. That is, if an enterprise manufactures more than one article or thing and it uses the know-how of the other for one article or thing, manufacture of all the articles or goods carried out by the first enterprise is not wholly dependent on the intangible asset of the other enterprise and hence section 92A(2)(g) does not apply here. The important phrase here is ‘wholly dependent’ and hence, it would first be imperative to determine whether a particular enterprise is dependent ‘wholly’ on the use of intangibles owned by the other enterprise. The word ‘wholly’ denotes complete dependence and hence, should be distinguished from the word ‘mainly’. Under this clause, all types of manufacturing, distribution and service-related businesses are covered. 3.12 Ninety per cent or more of the raw materials and consumables required for the manufacture or processing of goods or articles carried out by one enterprise, are supplied by the other enterprise or by persons specified by the other enterprise, and the prices and other conditions relating to the supply are influenced by such other enterprise. [Section 92A(2)(h)] There are two situations dealt with in this clause and they are as follows: (i) 90% or more of the raw materials and consumables required for manufacturing or processing of goods or articles are supplied by the other enterprise, or (ii) 90% or more of the raw materials and consumables required for manufacturing or processing of goods or articles are supplied by persons specified by the other enterprise, and  the prices and other conditions relating to supply (by the specified person) are influenced by the other enterprise. Since this clause relates to manufacture or processing of goods, it is important to note that the 90% criteria should be applied exclusively to raw materials and consumables used for manufacturing and processing only."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 50 3.13 The goods or articles manufactured or processed by one enterprise, are sold to the other enterprise or to persons specified by the other enterprise, and the prices and other conditions relating thereto are influenced by such other enterprise. [Section 92A(2)(i)] Where the goods or articles manufactured and processed by one enterprise, (say, enterprise A) are sold (i) to another enterprise (say, enterprise B) or (ii) sold to another enterprise (say, enterprise C) specified by enterprise B,  and  the prices and other conditions relating thereto are influenced by enterprise B, then enterprises A and B shall be associated enterprises. While in clause (h), a minimum criteria of 90% has been mentioned, no such quantification has been done in clause (i). It would be imperative to analyze the contractual terms & conditions, actual conduct of parties to the transaction, etc. to conclude whether there exists any influence by an enterprise on another enterprise and hence, whether the said clause is triggered or not. This clause covers only sale of goods manufactured or processed and not the sale of traded goods. Prima facie, it may be inferred that even when sales of one enterprise to the other enterprise is insignificant (assuming less than 1%) and that other enterprise can influence the prices at which the goods are sold, these two enterprises may be treated as associated enterprises. However, this may not be the intention of the legislation, as this may not give rise to “control” by one of the enterprise over the other, which is a sine qua non for invoking the status of associated enterprises under third limb of test laid down by section 92A(1). Therefore, it is important that the test of ‘influence’ be established with actual conduct and backed up by the documentary evidence. In this clause, the Seller and buyer are deemed AEs u/s 92A(2)(i) only if buyer’s influence on terms of sale is “dominant influence”. For deeming buyer and seller enterprises to be AEs under section 92A(2)(i), buyer must have dominant influence over prices and other conditions of sale amounting to de facto control of buyer over seller."
"Associated Enterprises  51  3.14 Where one enterprise is controlled by an individual, the other enterprise is also controlled by such individual or his relative or jointly by such individual and relative of such individual. [Section 92A(2)(j)] This clause deals with a situation where one enterprise is controlled by an individual and the other enterprise is also controlled by – (i) such individuals; or (ii) his relative; or (iii) jointly by such individual and his relative then both the enterprises shall be deemed as associated enterprises. The word ‘control’ can be interpreted to mean that the individual along with his relatives has the power to make crucial decisions regarding the management and running of the two enterprises. The word ‘relative’ is defined under section 2(41) of the Act as follows: “relative”, in relation to an individual, means the husband, wife, brother or sister or any lineal ascendant or descendant of that individual” 3.15 Where one enterprise is controlled by a Hindu undivided family, the other enterprise is controlled by a member of such Hindu undivided family, or by a relative of a member of such Hindu undivided family, or jointly by such member and his relative. [Section 92A(2)(k)] This clause envisages control of the two enterprises by the same Hindu undivided family and includes control by - (i) a member of the Hindu undivided family, or (ii) by a relative of a member of such Hindu undivided family, or (iii) jointly by such member and his relatives. 3.16 Where one enterprise is a firm, association of persons or body of individuals, the other enterprise holds not less than ten per cent interest in such firm, association of persons or body of individuals [Section 92A(2)(l)] This clause seeks to cover non-corporate bodies like partnership firms, association of persons and body of individuals. Sub-clause (v) of clause (31) of section 2 of the Act defines the term ‘person’ to include these entities."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 52 In case of partnership firm or association of persons or body of individuals, the other enterprise must hold not less than 10% interest in such firm, association of persons or body of individuals to be regarded as an associated enterprise. 3.17 There exists between the two enterprises, any relationship of mutual interest, as may be prescribed. [Section 92A(2)(m)] This residuary clause enables the CBDT to widen the scope by adding any relationship of mutual interest from time to time that will make any two enterprises as associated enterprises. However, no such relationship of mutual interest has yet been prescribed. 3.18 If an assessee enters into a transaction where one of the parties to the transaction is a person located in a notified jurisdictional area, then all the parties to the transaction shall be deemed to be associated enterprises within the meaning of section 92A [Section 94A(2)(i)] As per Section 94A(1), the Central Government may, specify a country or territory as a notified jurisdictional area. The Central Government had specified Cyprus as a notified jurisdictional area. However, the same has been rescinded vide notification no. 114 dated 14-12-2016. Therefore, at present there is no such notified jurisdictional area. This clause seeks to cover transactions with persons located in notified jurisdictional areas where there is a lack of effective exchange of information. The relationship with the “person” is not specified in the section. Accordingly, a person could be a related or an unrelated person and therefore a person could also include an AE [i.e. an enterprise covered under section 92A(1)/(2)] Relationship between Head Office and Permanent Establishment (Branch Office and any fixed place of business)   3.19  For a foreign enterprise, a branch office in India would qualify to be a permanent establishment (‘PE’) and considered as a separate enterprise than the foreign enterprise or the head office in terms of section 92F(iii) read with section 92B(1). Accordingly, transfer pricing provisions would apply on transactions between foreign enterprise and PE in India (branch office or any fixed place of the business)."
"Associated Enterprises  53 3.20. Attention here is invited to a situation where an Indian enterprise is having a branch office in a foreign jurisdiction. In such a scenario, the definition of permanent establishment as per section 92F(iii)(a) looses its substance and there the transactions between the Indian head office and its foreign branch office (branch office accounts being consolidated in the head office / company-wide accounts) would not be subject to transfer pricing provisions as per Indian Income tax Act. It is important to note that transaction between the foreign branch of India enterprise and other foreign associated enterprise will be subject to transfer pricing provision. Example: I. Co has a branch in the USA. I. Co also has a subsidiary company the USA, US Co. The USA branch is rendering certain services to the US Co. Since I. Co and USA branch are same legal entity for the application of Indian TP regulation, hence the transaction between US branch and US Co.  will be considered as transaction between I. Co and US Co.    Associated Enterprises in relation to ‘Specified Domestic Transactions (SDT)’  3.21 Rule 10A(a)(ii) of the Rules defines “Associated Enterprise” for purpose of SDT as follows: (a) the persons referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (2) of section 40A of the Act in respect of a transaction referred to in section 40A(2)(a) of the Act; (omitted by Finance Act 2017, with effect from 1 April 2017  (b) other units or undertakings or businesses of the same assessee in respect of a transaction referred to in section 80A of the Act or, as  the case may be, sub-section (8) of section 80-IA of the Act;  (c)  any other person referred to in sub-section (10) of section 80-IA of  the Act in respect of a transaction referred to therein; (d) other units, undertakings, enterprises or business of the assessee, or other person referred to in sub-section (10) of section 80-IA of the Act, as the case may be, in respect of a transaction referred to in section 10AA of the Act or the transactions referred to in Chapter VI-A to which the provisions of sub-section (8) or, as the case may be, the provisions of sub-section (10) of section 80-IA of the Act are applicable;"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 54 Associated Enterprises as per OECD and UN Framework 3.22 OECD Framework – The OECD Model tax convention defines Associated Enterprise in Article 9, which reads as under: 1. Where: (a)  an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 3.23 UN Framework – Para 1 of Article 9 of UN Model Convention defines Associated Enterprise, which reads as under: 1. Where: (a)  an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b)  the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 3.24 As can be seen from above, the Indian TP Regulations cast a broad net for two entities to be regarded as associated which is much wider in scope than the definition as per OECD and UN model conventions."
"Chapter 4 International Transaction Definition 4.1 The terms “international transaction” is defined in two steps – the term “transaction” is defined in section 92F(v) of the Act, while the term “international transaction” is defined in section 92B of the Act. Hence, before proceeding to analyse the expression “international transaction”, it would be useful to take note of the definition of the term “transaction”. The term ‘transaction’ has been defined in clause (v) of section 92F as under:- “(v) transaction includes an arrangement, understanding or action in concert: (i) whether or not such arrangement, understanding or action is formal or in writing; or (ii) whether or not such arrangement, understanding or action is intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings”. This definition is an inclusive definition and therefore wider in its scope. As per this definition, a transaction includes any arrangement, understanding or action, whether formal or informal, whether oral or in writing, whether legally enforceable or not. Therefore, in order to characterise a “transaction”as “international transaction”, it has to be demonstrated that the transaction arose in pursuant to an arrangement, understanding or action in concert. Such an arrangement is between the two parties and not any unilateral action by one of the parties without any binding obligation on the other or without any mutual understanding or contract. If one of the party by its own volition is incurring any expenditure for its own business purpose, then without there being any corresponding binding obligation on the other party or without any such kind of an arrangement actually existing in writing or oral or otherwise, it cannot be characterized as international transaction within the scope and definition of Section 92B (1).” Therefore, necessary factual analysis to be carried out to establish that AEs have any arrangement, understanding or action in concert."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  56  4.2 Section 92B defines an “international transaction” in the following manner: “For the purposes of this section and sections 92, 92C, 92D and 92E, “international transaction” means a transaction between two or more AEs, either or both of whom are non-residents, in the nature of purchase, sale or lease of tangible or intangible property, or provision of services, or lending or borrowing money or any other transaction having a bearing on the profits, income, losses or assets of such enterprises and shall include a mutual agreement or arrangement between two or more AEs for the allocation or apportionment of, or any contribution to, any cost or expense incurred or to be incurred in connection with a benefit, service or facility provided or to be provided to any one or more such enterprises - section 92B(1)”. “A transaction entered into by an enterprise with a person other than an AE shall, for the purposes of sub-section (1), be deemed to be an international transaction entered into between two AEs, if there exists a prior agreement in relation to the relevant transaction between such other person and the AE; or the terms of the relevant transaction are determined in substance between such other person and the AE where the enterprise or the AE or both of them are non-residents irrespective of whether such other person is a non-resident or not - section 92B(2)”. From the above, it can be seen that sub-section (1) of section 92B defines the term “international transaction” in an exhaustive manner; and sub-section (2) of section 92B deems a transaction entered into between two enterprises in certain situations, as an international transaction between AEs. 4.3 The definition of international transaction under the transfer pricing regulations is very wide in its scope and has been further clarified vide Finance Act 2012 with retrospective effect from 1 April, 2002 to include:  (i) the purchase, sale, transfer, lease or use of tangible property including building, transportation vehicle, machinery, equipment, tools, plant, furniture, commodity or any other article, product or thing; or"

Business Restructuring 4.3.2 It is relevant to note that a transaction of business restructuring or reorganization has been clarified to be an international transaction irrespective of whether it has a bearing on the profits, income, losses or assets of the enterprise. However, the Act does not define business restructuring. In this respect, guidance may be drawn from the OECD guidelines, which defines business restructuring as cross border re-organisation of the commercial or financial relations between AEs including the termination or substantial renegotiation of existing arrangements. Relationships with third parties (e.g. suppliers, sub-contractors, customers) may be a reason for the restructuring or be affected by it. 4.3.3 Restructuring could be in the form of operational change (in functional, asset and risk profile of the entity) or organizational change (in ownership structure/management of the entity). It could include a change in the nature or scope of transactions among controlled entities, a shift in the allocation of risks, a change in responsibility for specific functions or commencement or termination of a relationship, etc. 4.3.4  Explanation to 92B - Clause (i)(e) reads as under: “a transaction of business restructuring or reorganization, entered into by an enterprise with an associated enterprise, irrespective of the fact that it has bearing on the profit, income, losses or assets of such enterprises at the time of the transaction or at any future date” ‘Business restructuring or reorganization’ has not been defined in the Act, nor any guidance is provided in other income tax legislations (rules, circulars etc.) Chapter IX of OECD TP Guidelines – Report on TP aspects of Business Restructuring (July 2010) defines it as    “The cross-border redeployment, reallocation of functions, assets or risks among affiliated entities of a MNE”"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  60  4.3.5 Examples of Business Restructuring (only indicative and not exhaustive):  • Conversion of a full-fledged distributor into a LRD. • Conversion of a full-fledged manufacturer into a contract manufacturer • Transfer of IP rights to a central entity within the group • Business restructuring may also involve termination or substantial renegotiation of existing arrangements, reallocation of risks/ intangibles, specialisation or de-specialisation of operations i.e. manufacturing sites/ processes, R&D activities, sales activities etc. • Transfer of valuable intangibles  • Termination or substantial renegotiation of existing arrangements  • Conversion of full-fledged manufacturers into contractors or toll manufacturer • Conversion of full-fledged distributor into LRD or commissionaires • Outsourcing of manufacturing to AE in a low cost location • Centralization of intangibles assets and of risks (eg. to so called “IP Company”) or that of regional management • Revision of business model rationalization/ specialization/ de-specialization of operations (R&D, manufacturing, sales/ services) including downsizing and closing operations • The UN practical manual on TP for developing countries defines Business restructuring as the cross-border redeployment of functions, assets and risks by an MNE"

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  62  4.3.7  To determine whether any kind of compensation is payable at the time of restructuring, it is important to –  • Understand the FAR of the restructured entity before and after restructuring (including any loss of future expected profits on account of the business restructuring) • Understand the business reasons for and expected benefits from the change • Evaluate what other options/ alternatives are available to the parties involved • Consider whether an independent party would be willing to enter into a contract for such restructuring. Independent parties would not enter into a transaction that makes them worse off than their next best option. Note: The fact that a re-deployment of functions/assets/risks is based on sound commercial reasons does not necessarily mean that its at arm's length 4.3.8 Arm’s length Compensation in business restructuring: OECD Guidelines 2022 in Chapter IX (Part I and Part II) discusses Business Restructuring and remuneration of post-restructuring controlled transaction. This, inter alia, provides the following steps and process: Step 1: Characterize the transactions entered into by the associated enterprises, taking into account the business environment in which the multinational enterprises (MNE) group is operating. This entails carrying out the following activities: • identification of the scope of arrangements between the associated enterprises involved in the business restructuring. • Performance of a functional analysis of the pre- and post-business restructuring activities of associated enterprises affected by the restructuring. • reference to any relevant contract, including those entered to implement the business restructuring as well as an examination of risks assumed, and functions performed by the associated enterprises. • Examination of the consistency of the contractual terms with the outcome of the functional analysis of the associated enterprises taking part in the business restructuring, to determine the true nature"
"International Transaction  63  of the transactions, including the legal, economic and tax effects thereof. Step 2: Select the most appropriate transfer pricing methodology or methodologies • Provided the pricing of the business restructuring itself and of the post-restructuring arrangements are consistent with what would occur under an agreement between independent parties in comparable circumstances the arm’s length principle and its requirements are met. • The consideration may be determined by considering the following: o an arm’s length outcome is one that makes business sense taking into account the options realistically available for the taxpayer involved in the business restructuring. o an independent party dealing at arm’s length would seek to protect its economic interest involved in the arrangements or be appropriately remunerated for foregoing such interest. Step 3: Apply the most appropriate method and determine an arm’s length outcome • A benefit expected at the MNE level from a business restructuring may be any form of economic or commercial advantage. If the examination show that the pricing of the business restructuring does not make commercial sense, then arm’s length outcome can be achieved by either – o pricing adjustment by reference to the arrangement as entered by the parties. o using an arrangement reasonably expected to exist between independent parties dealing at arm’s length in comparable circumstances. o application of transfer pricing provisions adjusting the consideration receivable or payable by the Commissioner by reference to the arrangement between independent parties dealing in arm’s length in comparable circumstances."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  64  4.3.9  Selection and Application of TP Methods to Post-restructuring Transactions with Related Parties • Post-restructuring-controlled transactions require a robust FAR analysis. Essential to perform pre- and post-restructuring comparability analysis. • The analysis should go beyond the construed characterisation of the entity. o Situation A: an entity characterized as a LRD can sometimes be found to own valuable intangibles o Situation B: an entity characterized as a contract manufacturer can sometimes be found to pursue significant R&D activities or to own/ use unique intangibles • In some cases, pre-restructuring transactions may serve as an internal CUP for post-restructuring-controlled transactions 4.4 Any transaction between an enterprise and a person other than an AE will be deemed to be an international transaction with an AE as per sub-section (2) of section 92B under certain situations.This deeming provision is intended to cover cases where an independent third party (irrespective of whether it is a resident or non-resident) can be interposed by two AEs to remain out of the transfer pricing provisions of the Act. Deemed International Transaction 4.5 According to sub-section (2) of section 92B, a transaction between an enterprise and an unrelated person shall be deemed to be a transaction between AEs if in relation to that transaction - (i) there exists a prior agreement between such other person and the AE; or (ii) the terms of the relevant transaction are determined in substance between such unrelated person and the AE. 4.6 For example, enterprise X of India and enterprise Y of Australia are AEs. Enterprise Z of Singapore is not an AE of enterprise X. Enterprise Y and enterprise Z enter into an agreement for determining the terms of transactions between enterprise X and enterprise Z. The transaction as may be entered between enterprise X and enterprise Z which is governed by such an agreement existing between Y and Z shall be deemed to be a transaction"
"International Transaction  65  between two AEs. In this example the transaction could still be a deemed international transaction if Enterprise Z was an Indian resident. 4.7 Finance Act (No.2) 2014 has amended the said section w.e.f  1-4-2015 to provide that even where the unrelated third party is located in India, the transaction between the Indian entity and the unrelated third party will be deemed as an international transaction between the Indian entity and its AE located overseas. In the above case even if Z is an Indian resident, the transaction between X Co. and Z would be treated as deemed International Transaction. The amended provisions would certainly cover within its ambit a three party scenario under the provisions of section 92B(2). However, a four party situation would need a detailed analysis / evaluation by the accountant. The same is explained in the form of example below:    Outside India  India                                                                         Local Agreement  Associated Enterprise (Y)  Prior Agreement between Y and X  India Transaction between A Inc. and Indian Company Independent Party (Z )  Indian Company  (X Co.)

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  66  In the said case, ABC Plc. which is based outside India enters into an agreement with XYZ Plc. (an unrelated party) to procure (raw material) from XYZ Plc and all its subsidiaries on a global basis. Pursuant to the said agreement, ABC Ltd. which is a subsidiary of ABC Plc. procures raw material from XYZ Ltd which is a subsidiary of XYZ Plc. In light of the facts provided above, whether the arrangement between ABC Ltd. and XYZ Ltd. will be deemed to be an international transaction under Section 92B(2) of the Act for ABC Ltd.? Such cases should be analysed in detail by the accountant (having regard to the underlying facts and circumstances) before reaching to a conclusion. Impact of Amendment • The tax authorities may evaluate whether the profits earned in India is lower because of the influence of a non-resident AE on that transaction. • As per the amendment, domestic transactions which are influenced by a Non-resident AE would also be covered within the scope of TP provisions. • Care should be taken to properly report and disclose such transactions to avoid levy of penalty under Section 271AA. • Amendment may not cover transaction between two resident parties in India who are AEs. (Meaning of an AE and the scenarios where 2 persons can be regarded as AEs has been defined under section 92A(1) and 92A(2), respectively)"
"International Transaction  67  Example of Deemed International Transaction:  Case 1     Foreign Co has two subsidiaries in India (I Co 1 and I Co 2). I Co 1 proposed to transfer one of its business undertakings to I Co 2. There is an understanding that I Co 1 has with F Co regarding transfer of this business as well as the terms and conditions of transfer. Since I Co 1 and I Co 2 are AEs, provisions of section 92B(2) should not apply to the transaction of sale of business unit. However, sale of a business undertaking can involve termination/ renegotiation of an existing contract, which can be based on an understanding between I Co1 and F Co. In such case, an international transaction of ‘business restructuring’ can exist between I Co 1 and F Co as per the provisions of section. 92B(1) read with section 92F(v) of the Act.

Such transaction would be covered under the amended provision Tangible and intangible property  4.8 Tangible property has an existence in physical form. Any property other than tangible is intangible property. OECD Guidelines 2022 defines intangible as something which is not a physical asset or a financial asset1, which is capable of being owned or controlled for use in commercial activities, and whose use or transfer would be compensated had it occurred in a transaction between independent parties in comparable circumstances. OECD guidelines illustratively lists patents, know-how, trademarks, names and brands, rights under contracts and government licenses, goodwill, group synergies as intangible items. 4.9 Finance Act, 2012 inserted an explanation to Section 92B of the Act w..e.f 1-4-2012, which clarifies the expression “intangible property” for purposes of the Indian transfer pricing regulations to include- (i) marketing related intangibles assets, such as, trademarks, trade names, brand names, logos; or (ii) technology related intangibles assets, such as, process patents, patent applications, technical documentation such as laboratory notebooks, technical know-how; or (iii) artistic related intangible assets, such as, literary works and copyrights, musical compositions, copyrights, maps, engravings ; or (iv) data processing related intangible assets, such as proprietary computer software, software copyrights, automated databases, and integrated circuit masks and masters; or (v) engineering related intangible assets, such as industrial design,   1 According to the OECD Guidelines 2022, a financial asset is any asset that is cash, an equity instrument, a contractual right or obligation to receive cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial assets or liabilities, or a derivative. Examples include bonds, bank deposits, stocks, shares, forward contracts, futures contracts and swaps."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  70  product patents, trade secrets, engineering drawing and schema-tics, blueprints, proprietary documentation; or (vi) customer related intangible assets, such as, customer lists, customer contracts, customer relationship, open purchase orders; or (vii) contract related intangible assets, such as, favourable supplier, contracts, licence agreements, franchise agreements, non-compete agreements; or (viii) human capital related intangible assets, such as, trained and organised workforce, employment agreements, union contracts; or (ix) location related intangible assets, such as leasehold interest, mineral exploration rights, easements, air rights, water rights; or (x) goodwill related intangible assets, such as, institutional goodwill, professional practice goodwill, personal goodwill of professional, celebrity goodwill, general business going concern value; or (xi) methods, programmes, systems, procedures, campaigns, surveys, studies, forecasts, estimates, customer lists, or technical data; or (xii) any other similar item that derives its value from its intellectual content rather than its physical attributes. Given the wide scope of the phrase ‘international transaction’ and more particularly as regards ‘intangible property’ the accountant will need to exercise due diligence that all relevant transactions are considered and included in the report, whether these are included in the books of accounts or records of the assessee or not.2 The accountant should also review the record of any pending or past transfer pricing assessments or appeals of the assessee to identify any transaction not otherwise apparent from the books of accounts or records of the assessee. Where the accountant is unable to verify all such transactions due to any reason, and/ or relies upon explanations/ representations made to it by the assessee, and/ or there is a difference of opinion between the accountant and the assessee, such aspect   2 It may be mentioned that there may not be exact similarity between the definitions as per transfer pricing principles and accounting principles. In the Indian context ‘Intangible’ for transfer pricing purposes may be in variation with ‘intangible assets’ in accounting terms as per AS 26 and/or Ind AS 38."
"International Transaction  71  should be included in the accountant’s report as a note or qualification, as appropriate. 4.10 One of the most important aspects is to identify the intangibles, which are owned by the Group and the Indian entity. While, the above explanation provides detailed insights into the kind of intangibles, identification of intangibles, is an intensive process and requires detailed understanding of the industry and business model of the group and the Indian entity. The accountant can refer to the value driver analysis performed in the Master File, key customer contracts, customer relationships, vendor lists, etc. as reference points to identify intangibles, apart from the legally owned intangibles. 4.10.1 An intangible, for transfer pricing purposes, is something which: • Is not a physical asset or a financial asset • Is capable of being owned or controlled for use in commercial activities; and • Whose use or transfer would be compensated had it occurred in a transaction between independent parties in comparable circumstances • Legal, contractual, and other forms of protection may affect the value of an item and the returns that should be attributed to it – but the existence of such protection is not a necessary condition for an item to be characterised as an intangible for transfer pricing purposes. 4.10.2 Methods for valuing intangibles in Transfer Pricing (i) Market Approach:  • Estimates value based on actual market transactions • Requires the collection of market data from comparable transactions and analysis of the data to estimate the value of the intangible through comparison and correlation. (ii) Income Approach: • Considers income and expense data relating to the intangible and based on cash flow projections and discount rates computes a fair market value. • Includes the discounted cash flow method and the relief from royalty approach, two commonly used valuation methods."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  72  (iii) Cost Approach: • Values intangible assets based on their ‘cost to create’ or what it might cost to recreate a similar asset • The OECD Guidelines note that the use of methods that seek to estimate the value of intangibles based on the cost of intangible development is generally discouraged. 4.10.3  Valuation is an important consideration in the transfer/migration of intangibles Substance/commercial reasons for transferring intangibles is also critical. Since the ownership of intangibles can represent a major profit driver for a business, the valuation, pricing and supporting reasons for the transfer is paramount, particularly if intangibles ownership is being transferred from a high tax jurisdiction to a low tax jurisdiction. For the purpose of 92E report, part B of clause 12 in form 3CEB, the disclosure required is pertaining to amount paid/received or payable/receivable for purchase/ sale/transfer/lease/use of each category of intangible property (i) as per books of account; (ii) as computed by the assessee having regard to the arm’s length price. Professionals would base their independent opinions based on the valuation reports of other professionals. However, reasonable independent scrutiny and assessment on the following aspects is to be done: • Existence of such intangible, IP Structuring and Group Policies • Documentation being maintained • Prior history and cost base or Capitalisations/ accruals of the company  • Any patents, trademarks or registrations acquired • Valuation Methodologies, workings, assumptions, and the base/benchmark ratios/ calculations as compared to independent companies in similar industry Further, As all the intangibles referred to Explanation (ii) to Section 92B may not be separately accounted in the books of accounts (such as customer lists, human capital related intangibles, customer relationship, goodwill, etc), the accountant may need to rely on the transfer pricing documentation"
"International Transaction  73  maintained by the assessee under Rule 10D as well as obtain adequate representations from the management stating that all the international transactions relating to intangibles have been disclosed to the accountant. 4.11 There may be outright sale transaction for a consideration between the Associate Enterprises or there may be a License agreement between AEs for use of above intangibles. Intangibles are generally created by the manufacturing activities or Research & Development activities undertaken by the AEs, or there may be a case of marketing intangibles created by marketing, distribution and after sale-service by any AE. Chapter VI of the Transfer Price Guidelines by OECD (2017) provides guidance specifically tailored to determine ALP for transactions that involve the use/ transfer of intangibles. The BEPS Action Plan 8 of OECD suggests that profits associated with the transfer and use of intangibles is appropriately allocated in accordance with the value creation. Benchmarking of the use/ transfer of above intangibles between AEs needs to be properly made by the management based on generally accepted approaches for valuation like the Cost Approach, The Market Approach and the Earning Approach. The TP auditor needs to certify the ALP calculated by the assessee by applying any of the TP methods. 4.12 With respect to marketing intangible and particularly advertisement, marketing and promotional (‘AMP') expenses,  the accountant will need to exercise due diligence to establish whether the AMP expenses are incurred by AE in India to cater to the needs of the customers in the local market and not incurred at the instance or behest of overseas AE nor there was any mutual understanding or arrangement or allocation or contribution by the AE towards reimbursement of any part of AMP expenditure incurred by it for the purpose of its business. For carrying out this exercise cases decided on this should be kept in mind. Services, finances, and costs etc. 4.13 “Provision of services” refers to trade related services like intellectual property rights and trade related investments. According to the OECD guidelines, there are two main issues while analysing intra-group services: (i) whether an intra-group service that should be charged for has been provided; and (ii) what the charge should be in accordance with the arm’s length principle."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  74  In this regard, the accountant may refer to the following aspects while determining whether the intra-group services have been rendered: (a)  Benefits test – The basis to decide whether a service has been provided is set out in the guidelines as ‘whether an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances would have been willing to pay for the activity if performed for it by an independent enterprise or would have performed the activity in-house for itself. If the activity is not one for which the independent enterprise would have been willing to pay or perform for itself, the activity ordinarily should not be considered as an intra-group service under the arm’s length principle’. Services benefiting a group of enterprises as a whole should be allocated amongst the group in a way that matches the benefit received. (b)  Shareholder activities – An activity that a group member (usually the parent company or a regional holding company) performs solely because of its ownership interest in one or more other group members i.e in its capacity as shareholder. This type of activity would not be considered to be an intra-group service, and thus would not justify a charge to other group members. This type of activity may be referred to as a “shareholder activity”. Certain illustrative examples for Shareholder activities can be:  (i)  juridical structure of the parent company itself such as meetings of shareholders of the parent, issuing of shares in the parent company, stock exchange listing of parent company and cost of supervisory board;  (ii)  reporting requirements of parent company including consolidation of reports, parent company’s audit of subsidiary’s accounts carried out exclusively in the interest of parent company, preparation of consolidated financial statements of the MNE; (iii)  raising funds for the acquisition of its participations and costs relating to the parent company’s investor relations such as communication strategy;  (iv)  raising funds for the acquisition of its participations and costs relating to the parent company’s investor relations such as communication strategy;  (v)  ancillary to the corporate governance of the MNE as a whole. (c)  Duplicative activities – An activity which is undertaken by one group member that merely duplicate(s) a service that another group member is"
"International Transaction  75  performing for itself, or that is being performed for such other group member by a third party(s) are considered to duplicative activities. An exception may be where the duplication of services is only temporary, for example, where an MNE group is reorganising to centralise its management functions. Another exception would be where the duplication is undertaken to reduce the risk of a wrong business decision (e.g. by getting a second legal opinion on a subject). Furthermore, the fact that a company performs, for example, marketing services in-house and also is charged for marketing services from a group company does not of itself determine duplication, since marketing is a broad term covering many levels of activity. The Accountant shall examine the information provided by the taxpayer to determine whether the intra-group services are different, additional, or complementary to the activities performed in-house. The benefits test would then apply to those non-duplicative elements of the intra-group services. (d) Incidental Benefits – There can be some cases where an intra-group services performed by a group member such as a shareholder or coordinating centre relates only to some group members but incidentally provides benefits to other group members. Examples could be analysing the question whether to reorganize the group, to acquire new members, or to terminate a division. These activities could constitute intra-group services to the particular group members involved, for example those members who may make the acquisition or terminate one of their divisions, but they may also produce economic benefits for other group members not directly involved in the potential decision since the analysis could provide useful information about their own business operations. The incidental follow-on benefits that ordinarily would not cause these other group members to be treated as receiving an intra-group service because the activities producing the benefits would not be ones for which an independent enterprise ordinarily would be willing to pay. Similarly, an associated enterprise should not be considered to receive an intra-group service when it obtains incidental benefits attributable solely to it being part of a larger concern, and not to any specific activity being performed. For example, no service would be received where an associated enterprise by reason of its affiliation alone has a credit-rating higher than it would if it were unaffiliated, but an intra-group service would usually exist where the higher credit rating were due to a guarantee by another group member, or where the enterprise benefitted from deliberate concerted action involving global marketing and public relations campaigns."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  76  Capital financing transactions 4.14 The AEs often enter into transactions of capital financing including borrowing, lending, guarantee arrangements, etc. The pricing of these arrangements will have a bearing on the profits or losses of the AEs and hence are included as part of the definition of ‘international transaction’. These transactions of capital financing including any type of long-term or short-term borrowing, lending or guarantee, purchase or sale of marketable securities or any type of advance, payments or deferred payment or receivable or any other debt arising during the course of business are expressly covered as international transactions vide Finance Act 2012.The accountant will need to carefully identify and report such transactions and particularly equity and preference capital, debentures, guarantees provided or received, etc. Advance payments received or made and debts arising during the course of business shall need to be carefully considered and reported by the accountant however ensuring that there is no duplication or overlap with reporting of the principal transactions to which such advances or debts relate to, unless the accountant identifies factors which cause such advances or debts as separate transactions. The OECD has released “OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations” in January 2022 incorporating discussion on transfer aspects of financial transactions in Chapter X. It seeks to provide guidance for determining whether the conditions of certain financial transactions between associated enterprises are consistent with the arm’s length principle. This may be referred to while analysing financial transactions for the purposes of the certificate under section 92E of the Act. The accountant shall consider disclosing the transactions in relation to advance, payments or deferred payment or receivable or any other debt arising during the course of business either by way of a note in the ‘detailed observation/remarks’ section of the respective underlying primary transaction to which such balances pertain to or make a separate disclosure of such balances along with a description of the underlying primary transaction to which it is closely linked. Cost contribution arrangement 4.15 Agreement or arrangement represents understanding, and not a transaction as ordinarily understood as being some business or dealing, which is carried on or transacted between two or more persons. It is"
"International Transaction  77  reciprocal to contribute to the cost or incur expenditure for the mutual advantage or to share according to the agreement or the arrangement. Such agreement or arrangement is not in the nature of conveying any property or provision of services or lending or borrowing and is known as ‘cost contribution arrangement’. 4.16 The cost contribution arrangements, as aforesaid, are arrangements between business enterprises to share the costs and risks of jointly developing, producing, or obtaining assets, services or rights. Its conditions should be in conformity with arm’s length principle and therefore, a participant's contributions must be consistent with what an independent enterprise would have agreed to contribute under comparable circumstances given the benefits it reasonably expects to derive from the arrangement. The accountant should gain an understanding of the transaction and make appropriate reporting for the same. Free of cost transfer of goods or services 4.17 When determining whether or not international transaction exist in the books of accounts or records of the Assessee, the Accountant also need to consider the free of cost goods / services rendered / availed by the Assessee. A reference can also be placed on the positions adopted by the taxpayer under for GST for such free of cost goods / services by the Assessee. 4.18  The Accountant will need to carefully examine the necessary facts/ conditions to assess and identify such transactions not otherwise apparent from books of accounts or records of the Assessee and make appropriate reporting for the same. Where amounts are recognized on a notional basis in the books of accounts due to applicable accounting standards or otherwise, the same should be in conformity with arm’s length principle. Examples of such transactions may include free of cost employee stock option plans, free of cost software / software related services, free of cost management services, etc. 4.19  To the extent there is an intentional set-off or where the pricing of the principal transaction is determined (basis functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed) after considering the free of cost transfers, a separate disclosure of such free of cost transfers may not be necessary. However, the fact of such set-off could be included in the accountant’s report as a note. Same is the case with ‘shareholder activities’ and ‘incidental benefits’ that are not compensable."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  78  Example:             Outside India           India     F Co. has entered into a service agreement with India Co. for provision of IT services. As per the inter-company agreement, F Co. provides the necessary software/ tools, provides management oversight, and supervises the work carried out by India Co. The compensation to India Co. is agreed having regard to the roles and responsibilities of both the parties, including the free of cost software/ management services received by India Co. In such a case, a separate disclosure of such free of cost transfers may not be necessary. 4.20 The primary responsibility for the disclosing of such transactions rests with the taxpayer and the Accountant is entitled to place reliance on the representations provided by the taxpayer as to the details / completeness of such transactions. Cross-border transactions- Interplay of section 9 and section 92A 4.21 For a transaction to be an international transaction, it should satisfy the following two conditions cumulatively:  (a) it must be a transaction between two AEs; and (b) at least one of the two enterprises must be a non-resident. 4.22  A transaction is considered to be a cross-border transaction if it originates in one country and gets concluded in another country. A cross-border transaction may or may not be an international transaction within the meaning of Chapter X of the Act. Similarly, a transaction which is not a cross-border transaction may still be an international transaction for the India Co (AE of F Co.)  F Co. IT Service agreement"
"International Transaction  79  purpose of the said chapter if it falls within the ambit of the definition of “international transaction”. 4.23 For example, it may be assumed that there are two US companies which are AEs. If the Indian subsidiary of one such US (holding) company enters into a transaction with the Indian branch or the permanent establishment in India of the other US company, this transaction, even through it has originated, executed and concluded within India, shall be an international transaction as it is between two AEs and one of the party is a non-resident. 4.24 In alternative, assume that there is an Indian company which is the holding company of two Indian (subsidiary) companies. The two Indian companies are AEs since they are subsidiaries of a common holding company. If one such Indian subsidiary company enters into a transaction with the foreign branch of the other Indian subsidiary company, such transaction shall not be regarded as an international transaction. In this case, even though the transaction is between two AEs, both the parties to the transaction are residents. For a transaction to be regarded an international transaction, either or both the parties must be non-residents. An important aspect to be noted here is that even though the above mentioned transaction is not an international transaction but it may  be covered under domestic transfer pricing, subject to fulfilment of conditions prescribed under section 92BA, as per the amendements made vide Finance Act 2012 and the ALP would have to be determined having regard to transfer pricing provisions. 4.25 Even where a transaction is between two non-resident AEs, the provisions of chapter X of the Act shall apply so long as the income arising therefrom is assessable within the perview of the Act. It is possible that an international transaction between two AEs, both of whom are non-residents, may not attract the provisions of chapter X of the Act if the income from such transction is not taxable in India and falls outside the scope of total income assessable under the Act."
" Chapter 4A Specified Domestic Transactions 4A.1 Transfer pricing regulations have been extended vide Finance Act 2012 to include transactions entered into with domestic related parties or by an undertaking with other undertakings of the same entity for the purposes of section 40A (now omitted), Chapter VI-A and section 10AA. Domestic transfer pricing provisions are applicable from Assessment Year 2013-14 onwards. 4A.2 All of the compliance requirements relating to transfer pricing documentation, accountant’s report, etc shall equally apply to specified domestic transactions as they do for international transactions amongst associated enterprises. Definition 4A.3 The definition of section 92BA which defines Specified Domestic Transaction (SDT) has been amended vide Finance Act, 2017 to omit transactions in the nature of expenditure for which payment has been made or would be made to persons specified in section 40A(2)(b). The said amendment is applicable for assessment year 2017-18 i.e. previous year 2016-17. Section 92BA defines SDT which is covered by TP regulationsas under: “For the purposes of this section and sections 92, 92C, 92D and 92E, “specified domestic transaction” in case of an assessee means any of the following transactions, not being an international transaction, namely:— ⎯ any transaction referred to in section 80A; ⎯ any transfer of goods or services referred to in sub-section (8) of section 80-IA; ⎯ any business transacted between the assessee and other person as referred to in sub-section (10) of section 80-IA; ⎯ any transaction, referred to in any other section under Chapter VI-A or section 10AA, to which provisions of sub-section (8) or sub-section (10) of section 80-IA are applicable; or"
"Specified Domestic Transactions  81 ⎯ any business transacted between the persons referred to in sub-section (6) of section 115BAB; ⎯ any other transaction as may be prescribed,  and where the aggregate of such transactions entered into by the assessee in the previous year exceeds a sum of Rupees Twenty Crores. Threshold Limit 4A.4 The above referred transactions will be regarded as SDT only if the aggregate value of all the above specified transactions exceeds the threshold limit of Rupees 20 Crores (w.e.f 1st April 2016 onwards). If the threshold limit is crossed, the taxpayer will be required to comply with TP requirements with reference to all the transactions regardless of the fact that that the value of transactions under one of the limbs may be very small or nominal. Thus, there is no internal threshold for each limb of the definition. 4A.5  The threshold limit for SDT can be computed either on net basis (i.e. without including indirect tax levies like service tax, VAT, etc.) if the assessee is availing credit of those indirect taxes or on gross basis if the assessee is not availing credit, depending upon the method of accounting regularly followed. A useful reference may be made to the paragraph relating to Sales, Turnover, Gross Receipts under Guidance Note on Tax Audit u/s. 44AB issued by the Institute for the purpose of determining the threshold limit. 4A.6 Transactions covered under section 80A, 80-IA and 10AA Section 92BA extends to: (i) any transaction referred to in section 80A; (ii) any transfer of goods or services referred to in sub-section (8) of section 80-IA; (iii) any business transacted between the assessee and other person as referred to in sub-section (10) of section 80-IA; (iv) any transaction, referred to in any other section under Chapter VI-A or section 10AA, to which provisions of sub-section (8) or sub-section (10) of section 80-IA are applicable 4A.7 Transactions covered under section 80A Section 80A applies to deductions to be made in computing total income under Chapter VI-A. Though the reference in section 92BA is to section 80A"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  82 in general, on a closer examination, it becomes clear that the reference is merely to sub-section (6) of section 80A and not to any other sub-section since other sub-section of section 80A merely regulates the quantum of deduction and does not involve fair pricing of any transaction. This is also supported by corresponding amendment made to section 80A(6) by Finance Act 2012 to amend the meaning of expression ‘market value’ referred to in that sub-section and to provide that in case of specified domestic transactions, the market value shall be computed at arm’s length price. 4A.8 Section 80A (6) of the Act provides that “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 10A or section 10AA or section 10B or section 10BA or in any provisions of this Chapter under the heading “C— Deductions in respect of certain incomes”, where any goods or services held for the purposes of the undertaking or unit or enterprise or eligible business are transferred to any other business carried on by the assessee or where any goods or services held for the purposes of any other business carried on by the assessee are transferred to the undertaking or unit or enterprise or eligible business and, the consideration, if any, for such transfer as recorded in the accounts of the undertaking or unit or enterprise or eligible business does not correspond to the market value of such goods or services as on the date of the transfer, then, for the purposes of any deduction under this Chapter, the profits and gains of such undertaking or unit or enterprise or eligible business shall be computed as if the transfer, in either case, had been made at the market value of such goods or services as on that date. Explanation — For the purposes of this sub-section, the expression “market value”,— (i) in relation to any goods or services sold or supplied, means the price that such goods or services would fetch if these were sold by the undertaking or unit or enterprise or eligible business in the open market, subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions, if any;  (ii) in relation to any goods or services acquired, means the price that such goods or services would cost if these were acquired by the undertaking or unit or enterprise or eligible business from the open market, subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions, if any;  (iii) in relation to any goods or services sold, supplied or acquired means the arm’s length price as defined in clause (ii) of section"

By virtue of the amendment made to the above explanation vide Finance Act 2012, on lines of extension of Explanation to section 80A(6) defining market value, the Explanation under this provision has also been expanded to provide that the market value shall be computed at arm’s length price if the inter unit transfer constitutes specified domestic transaction. 4A.13 Transfers referred to in section 80-IA(10) The third limb of section 92BA refers to business transacted between the assessee and any other person as referred to in sub-section (10) of section 80-IA."
"Specified Domestic Transactions  85 4A.14 Section 80-IA(10) reads as under: “Where it appears to the Assessing Officer that, owing to the close connection between the assessee carrying on the eligible business to which this section applies and any other person, or for any other reason, the course of business between them is so arranged that the business transacted between them produces to the assessee more than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in such eligible business, the Assessing Officer shall, in computing the profits and gains of such eligible business for the purposes of the deduction under this section, take the amount of profits as may be reasonably deemed to have been derived therefrom.” “Provided that in case the aforesaid arrangement involves a specified domestic transaction referred to in section 92BA, the amount of profits from such transaction shall be determined having regard to arm’s length price as defined in clause (ii) of section 92F” 4A.15 Section 80-IA (10) applies to transactions between the assessee and any other person which results in excessive profits in the hands of the assessee: (a)  either owing to close connection with other person; or (b)  for any other reason. The dealings between taxpayer and other person get covered by section 80-IA(10) provided the course of business between them is so arranged that the transaction produces more than ordinary profits in the eligible business. 4A.16 Transactions in other provisions to which section 80-IA(8)/(10) apply  Specified domestic transactions as defined in section 92BA also refer to any transaction, referred to in any other section under Chapter VI-A or section 10AA, to which provisions of section 80-IA(8) and section 80-IA(10) are applicable.

Hence, if a company is seeking benefits of lower rate of tax under section 115BAB then the auditor should examine whether transaction would be covered under the first proviso to sub-section (6) as mentioned above and take action accordingly."
" Chapter 5 Arm’s Length Price Meaning and determination 5.1 In commercial parlance, an arm’s length price is the price at which independent enterprises deal with each other, where the conditions of their commercial and financial relations ordinarily are determined by market forces. Section 92F(ii) of the Act, defines the arm’s length price as a price which is applied or proposed to be applied in a transaction between persons other than associated enterprises (‘AE’), in uncontrolled conditions. 5.2 The steps involved in the determination of the arm’s length price can be summarised as follows: (i) identification of the “international transaction/(s)” or specified domestic transaction/(s); (ii) identification of the functions performed, assets employed, and risks assumed (‘FAR’) by the taxpayer and the AE being parties to the transaction(s); (iii) deciding the characterisation of the entities who are party to the transaction based on the analysis of functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed; (iv)  deciding if the international transactions or specified domestic transactions are closely linked or not [Rule 10A(d)] and accordingly functional analysis to be done using aggregation of transaction or transaction by transaction approach; (v) identification / selection of the tested party (for application of resale price method, cost plus method and transactional net margin method); (vi) identification of the most appropriate method which will, inter-alia, include: a)  identification of an “uncontrolled transaction” - Rule 10A (ab); ⎯ Review of existing internal uncontrolled transaction, if any; ⎯ Determination of available sources of information on external"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  88 comparables where such external comparables are needed taking into account their relative reliability. Identification and comparison of specific characteristics embodied in international transactions or specified domestic transactions and uncontrolled transactions-Rule 10B(2); b)  finding out whether uncontrolled transactions and international transactions or specified domestic transactions can be compared by reconciling/resolving differences, if any - Rule 10B(3); (vii) ascertaining the most appropriate method by applying the tests laid down - Rule 10C; (viii) determination of the arm’s length price by applying the method chosen - Rule 10B(1). Please note that step (vi) is a repetitive exercise (in respect of each of the prescribed methods) until a satisfactory conclusion is reached thereby leading to selection of the most appropriate method out of the methods prescribed under Section 92C(1) of the Act. Further, no particular method has been accorded any priority under the Indian Transfer Pricing legislation. The most appropriate method is to be selected having regard to the nature of the transaction(s), functions performed by the parties involved in the transaction(s) and other relevant factors. Example – ABC India is engaged in distribution of XYZ brand printers in the Indian market, which are manufactured by ABC Inc. (a US based group entity). Apart from the distribution of printers, ABC India also imports printer cartridges and other spares from its group entity ABC Inc, which are used in the after-sales business. The international transactions in this case are import of printers and import of cartridges & spares. The typical steps involved in determination of the arm’s length price in the above example could be as follows: Identify international transactions 1. Import of printers; and 2. Import of cartridges and spares. Decide if the transactions are closely linked In the present case, if ABC India follows a business strategy where it targets to sell the printers to penetrate the market and thereafter get recurring"
"Arm’s Length Price 89 business through  sale of cartridges, then the transaction of import of printers and import of cartridges and spares could be said to be closely linked, and may be evaluated using aggregation approach. FAR analysis Undertake an in-depth FAR analysis of ABC India and ABC Inc. For instance, ABC India performs functions in the nature of procurement, quality control, inventory management, marketing and sales promotion (limited) etc., employs assets in the nature of office premises, warehouses etc. and assumes limited market and inventory risks amongst others. On the other hand, ABC Inc. performs functions in the nature of corporate strategy formulation, product research and development, manufacturing, pricing etc., employs assets in the nature of manufacturing know-how, brand, manufacturing facilities, warehouses etc. and assumes product liability, research and development, market risks amongst others. Characterization of the parties involved in the aforementioned transactions and accordingly selecting the tested party  If after an in-depth FAR analysis of ABC India and ABC Inc, ABC India is characterised as a limited risk distributor and ABC Inc. is characterised as a full-fledged manufacturer and further reliable comparable data for ABC India can be found, then typically ABC India being the entity with the least complex FAR shall be selected as the tested party. Ascertaining the most appropriate method and determination of the arm’s length price  After a careful examination of the facts and circumstances of the case and further after applying the tests laid down in Rule 10C, in the instant case, the resale price method could be selected as the most appropriate method. Further, in case where no internal comparable data is available, external comparable data could be identified through available sources of information and accordingly the arm’s length price can be ascertained. 5.3 Section 92C(1) stipulates that the arm’s length price is to be determined by adopting any one of the following methods, being the most appropriate method: • Comparable Uncontrolled Price method (CUP method)"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  90 • Resale Price Method (RPM) • Cost Plus Method (CPM) • Profit Split Method (PSM) • Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) • Other Method (OM) as prescribed by the Board and provided in Rule 10AB1. 5.4 Rule 10C(1) lays down the general guidelines in the selection of the most appropriate method. The Rule states that the method to be selected shall be the one best suited to the facts and circumstances of each international transaction or specified domestic transaction and that provides the most reliable measure of the arm’s length price. 5.5 Rule 10C(2) lists the specific factors that should be taken into account in the process of selecting the most appropriate method. These factors are as under: (i) nature and class of international transactions or specified domestic transactions; (ii) class or classes of AEs entering into the transaction and the functions performed by them taking into account the assets employed or to be employed and risks assumed by such enterprises; (iii) availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for application of the method. For instance, data relating to transactions entered into by the enterprise itself would be more reliable than the data relating to transactions entered into by third parties; (iv) the degree of comparability existing between the international transaction or specified domestic transaction and uncontrolled transaction and between enterprises entering into such transactions (v) the extent to which reliable and accurate adjustments can be made to account for the difference between the transactions. (vi) the nature, the extent and reliability of assumptions required to be made in application of a method. 1 Rule 10AB vide Notification No. 18/2012 [F. NO. 142/5/2012-TPL] dated 23 May 2012, applicable for assessment year 2012-13 and onwards"
"Arm’s Length Price 91 5.6 Rule 10C, inter alia, specifies that the availability, coverage and reliability of data and whether reasonably accurate and reliable adjustments could be made as the relevant considerations in selecting the most appropriate method. In actual practice, the choice of most appropriate method depends not only on the nature and character of international transaction or specified domestic transaction but also on the availability of comparable transactions and data. Hence, the selection of most appropriate method is a process of applying both the criteria. It may happen that what appears to be most appropriate method on the basis of nature of international transaction or specified domestic transaction may not be eventually selected because of non-availability of comparable data. The following example would clarify. An enterprise may buy from its AE and resell in India. The transaction itself suggests that the most appropriate method is Resale Price Method (RPM). There may not be any internal comparable transaction available. Even an external comparable may not be available. Even if an external comparable is available, the available data may not be sufficient to determine the Arm’s length Gross Profit. Therefore, RPM may not be most appropriate method and some other method is to be chosen. The selection of most appropriate method is a process of continuously evaluating the nature and characteristics of international transactions or specified domestic transactions and the comparable transactions. 5.7 The factors referred to above are to be applied cumulatively in selecting the most appropriate method. The reference therein to the terms ‘best suited’ and ‘most reliable measure’ indicates that the most appropriate method will have to be selected after a meticulous appraisal of the facts and circumstances of the international transaction or specified domestic transaction. Further, the selection of the most appropriate method shall be for each particular international transaction or specified domestic transaction. The term ‘transaction’ itself is defined in rule 10A(d) to include a number of closely linked transactions. Therefore, though the reference is to apply the most appropriate method to each particular transaction, keeping in view, the definition of the term ‘transaction’, the most appropriate method may be chosen for a group of closely linked transactions. Two or more transactions can be said to be linked when these transactions emanate from a common source being an order or a contract or an agreement or an arrangement and the nature, characteristics and terms of these transactions are substantially flowing from the said common source. For example, a master purchase order is issued stating the various terms and conditions and subsequently,"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  92 individuals orders are released for specific quantities. The various purchase transactions are closely linked transactions. 5.8 It may be noted that in order to be closely linked transactions, it is not necessary that these transactions need to be identical or even similar. For example, a collaboration agreement may provide for import of raw materials, sale of finished goods, provision of technical services and payment of royalty. Different methods may be chosen as the most appropriate methods for each of the above transactions when considered on a standalone basis. However, under particular circumstances, one single method may be chosen as the most appropriate method covering all the above transactions as the same are closely linked. 5.9 There is yet another category of transactions which may be identical or similar though not closely linked. For example, independent purchase transactions having identical or similar nature, characteristics, terms and conditions are not closely linked transactions because these transactions do not emanate from a common source. However, under particular circumstances, one single method may still be chosen as the most appropriate method covering all the above transactions. The following examples, [referred in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2017)], may be useful in this regard: “Examples may include 1. Some long-term contracts for the supply of commodities or services, 2. rights to use intangible property, and 3. pricing a range of closely-linked products(e.g. in a product line) when it is impractical to determine pricing for each individual product or transaction.” (Para 3.9) “Another example where a taxpayer’s transactions may be combined is related to portfolio approaches. A portfolio approach is a business strategy consisting of a taxpayer bundling certain transactions for the purpose of earning an appropriate return across the portfolio rather than necessarily on any single product within the portfolio. For instance, some products may be marketed by a taxpayer with a low profit or even at a loss, because they create a demand for other products and/or related services of the same taxpayer that are then sold or provided with high profits (e.g. equipment and captive aftermarket consumables, such as vending coffee machines and coffee capsules, or printers and cartridges). Similar approaches can be observed in various industries. Portfolio approaches arean"
"Arm’s Length Price 93 example of a business strategy that may need to be taken into account in the comparability analysis and when examining the reliability of comparables.” (Para 3.10) 5.10 It is not uncommon to notice transactions which are not only dissimilar or unidentical but are also not linked .For example, there may be transactions of purchase, sale and provision of technical service. In such case, wherever internal comparables are available, appropriate method should be used if the circumstances so justify. 5.11 Section 92C(2) provides that most appropriate method referred to in section 92C(1) shall be applied, for determination of arm’s length price, in the manner as prescribed in Rule 10B. The first proviso to section 92C(2) provides that where more than one price is determined by the most appropriate method, the arm’s length price shall be taken to be the arithmetical mean of such prices. The second proviso to section 92C(2) provides that if the variation between the arm’s length price, so determined and price at which the transaction has actually been undertaken does not exceed such percentage as may be notified2 by the Central Government in the Official Gazette, the price at which the international transaction [ or the specified domestic transaction] has been undertaken will be deemed to be the arm’s length price. The variation is to be computed with reference to the actual price at which the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] has been undertaken. This proviso shall be applicable for assessment or reassessment proceedings pending before an Assessing Officer as on 1 October 2009. 5.12 The aforesaid amended second proviso refers to arm’s length price (and not ‘arithmetic mean’ – as was the case in Finance Act 2002), and a view can be adopted that it is applicable to any ‘arm’s length price’  2 Notification dated 13 September 2019, the rate of 1 percent for wholesale trading transaction and 3 percent in all other cases for financial year 2018-19  CBDT has also defined the term “wholesale trading” as “an International Transaction or a Specified Domestic Transaction of trading in goods, which fulfills the following conditions, namely:  a) purchase cost of finished goods is 80% or more of the total cost pertaining to such  trading activities; and  b) average monthly closing inventory of such goods is 10% or less of sales pertaining  to such trading activities."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  94 determined (whether as a single comparable price, or as arithmetic mean of multiple comparable prices). Notably, only one method out of the 6 methods can be identified as the most appropriate method for a given transaction. Such most appropriate method may lead to a single comparable price or multiple prices. The arm’s length price is the single comparable price or arithmetic mean of multiple comparable prices arrived at by application of the most appropriate method. 5.13 The proviso provides that the arithmetical mean of such prices shall be the arm’s length price A.

However, if the transfer price was less than INR 7,433, then it could vary from ALP only to the extent of the notified percent (not exceeding 3 percent) of the actual value of international transaction. An example to illustrate this is as follows: Scenario 1: Transfer Price is INR 7,000 and ALP is INR 7,433 Difference between the transaction price and arm’s length price INR 433 3% of the transaction value  INR 210 Since the difference between the transaction price and the arm’s length price is more than 3% of the transaction price, the transaction will be considered not to be at arm’s length  In case of a wholesale distributor, instead of 3%, 1% of the transaction price will be considered."

With the introduction of the new mechanism, the provisions of first and second proviso (i.e. arithmetic mean and tolerable range) shall not apply. CBDT vide Notification No. 83/2015 has introduced the use of the range concept as well as the use of multiple year data. Detailed discussion on the same in provided in Chapter 1 of this publication. Uncontrolled transaction 5.15 Rule 10A(ab) defines an “uncontrolled transaction” to mean “a transaction between enterprises other than associated enterprises, whether resident or non-resident”. When an uncontrolled transaction has been entered into, it could be said that it has been contracted under “uncontrolled conditions”. 5.16 An uncontrolled transaction can be between: • a resident and a non-resident; or  • a resident and a resident; or  • a non-resident and a non-resident. 5.17 While selecting, uncontrolled transaction / companies, due care should be taken to identify / make appropriate adjustment for the differences between the international transaction [or specified domestic transaction]"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  96 being evaluated and the comparable transaction so selected to ensure an appropriate comparison. Comparable uncontrolled transactions 5.18 Rule 10B(2), lays down the criteria for comparability between international transactions [or specified domestic transactions] and uncontrolled transactions. This process is not quantitative but qualitative and involves exercise of judgment. The criteria listed in Rule 10B(2) are: • distinctive nature of the property transferred or services provided; • functions performed taking into account the assets employed or to be employed; • risks assumed by the respective parties; • contractual terms of the transaction; • market conditions. Distinctive nature of the property and services 5.19 The following are some of the characteristics to be assessed vis-à-vis the property transferred or service provided: In the case of transfer of tangible property: • the physical features of the property; • its quality and reliability; and • the availability and volume of supply. In the case of provision of services: • the nature and extent of the services. More specifically for financing services in the nature of intra-group funding/ loan transactions, corporate guarantee loan arrangements, etc., the following characteristics needs to be assessed: • the nature/ type of the financial transaction; • the purpose of the transaction; and • the duration and covenants of the financial transaction; etc In the case of intangibles: • the form of the transaction (eg. licensing or sale);"
"Arm’s Length Price 97 • the terms of the transaction; • the type of property (eg. patent, trademark or know-how); • the duration and extent of protection; • anticipated benefits from the use of the property etc. The following examples, taken from New Zealand transfer pricing guidelines, may be referred to • An alkaline battery would sell at a premium to a standard (zinc carbon) battery, because the superior quality alkaline battery would be expected to last significantly longer than the standard battery. • A battery with a known brand would sell for more than an unknown brand, even if the quality of the two batteries were identical. Other things being equal, consumers would be expected to prefer the battery with an established reputation for reliability. • A multi coloured battery may sell for more than an equivalent black battery, depending on the extent to which consumer’s preference is influenced by packaging. Whether the transactions as illustrated in the aforesaid examples can be taken as comparable transactions or not would depend on the availability of data for making the reasonably accurate adjustments for the differences that affect prices / profits in the open market. 5.20 Further, the following guidance, from the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2017), may also be referred to: “Para 1.108Depending on the transfer pricing method, this factor must be given more or less weight. Among the methods described at Chapter II of these Guidelines, the requirement for comparability of property or services is the strictest for the comparable uncontrolled price method. Under the comparable uncontrolled price method, any material difference in the characteristics of property or services can have an effect on the price and would require an appropriate adjustment to be considered. Under the resale price method and cost plus method, some differences in the characteristics of property or services are less likely to have a material effect on the gross profit margin or mark-up on costs. Differences in the characteristics of property or services are also less sensitive in the case of the transactional profit methods than in the case of traditional transaction methods. This however does not mean that the question of"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  98 comparability in characteristics of property or services can be ignored when applying these methods, because it may be that product differences entail or reflect different functions performed, assets used and/or risks assumed bythe tested party. Para 1.109 In practice, it has been observed that comparability analyses for methods based on gross or net profit indicators often put more emphasis on functional similarities than on product similarities. Depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, it may be acceptable to broaden the scope of the comparability analysis to include uncontrolled transactions involving products that are different, but where similar functions are undertaken. However, the acceptance of such an approach depends on the effects that the product differences have on the reliability of the comparison and on whether or not more reliable data are available. Before broadening the search to include a larger number of potentially comparable uncontrolled transactions based on similar functions being undertaken, thought should be given to whether such transactions are likely to offer reliable comparables for the controlled transaction.” Analysis of functions performed 5.21 Functions are defined as the activities that each of the entities engaged in a particular transaction perform as a part of its operations This functional analysis seeks to identify the economically significant activities and responsibilities undertaken, assets used or contributed, and risks assumed by the parties to the transactions. To illustrate, provided below are some typical functions undertaken in the context of manufacturing, research & development and distribution: • raw material procurement • production scheduling • manufacturing of the products • inventory management of raw materials and finished goods • product research, design and development • developing and administering budgets • production planning and scheduling • quality control • packaging and labelling of products"
"Arm’s Length Price 99 • warehousing • sales and marketing • technical services • shipping of products to customers • administrative services • after sales support Analysis of assets employed 5.22 Transactions that are proposed to be compared should be analysed for the assets employed. In this context, some of the following points may be noted; a) Whether assets are owned or leased b) Whether activity is capital or labour intensive c) Presence or absence of intangibles d) Are the assets unique in nature (like an Intellectual Property) Typical intangible assets could be as follows: • Patents • Unpatented technical know-how • Formulae • Trademarks and brand names • Trade names • Copyrights • Technical information • Customer list • Franchises • Marketing channel • Highly qualified personnel 5.23 Intangibles can be ordinarily divided into two categories: manufacturing and marketing. Manufacturing intangibles are characterised as one of the two types – patents or non-patented technical know-how – and arise out of either research and development activity or the production engineering activities of the manufacturing plant."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  100 5.24 Marketing intangibles include trademarks, corporate reputation, the distribution network and the ability to provide services to customers before and / or after the sale. 5.25 While carrying out the above analysis, it is necessary to assess whether the assets employed in the respective transactions significantly affect their comparability. 5.26 Further, it is not necessary that the assets are recorded in the balance sheet for it to have significant value for transfer pricing purposes. Even in cases where the assets (say intangibles) are not recorded in the balance sheet, due consideration should be given to the same while undertaking the functional analysis. Analysis of risks assumed 5.27 An entity’s return is usually reflective of the risks assumed by it – higher the risks, higher are the returns. 5.28 Transactions that are proposed to be compared should be analysed for the risk-content. Some of the significant risks present in a normal transaction are: Nature of risks Particulars 1. Financial risk a. Capital contribution b. Method of funding c. Funding of losses 2. Product risk a. Design and development ofproduct b. Up-gradation of product c. After Sales Service  d. Risks associated with R & D e. Product liability risk f. Intellectual property risk if any  3. Market risk a. Development of market including advertisement and product promotion etc. b. Business volume risk c. Assured sales risk d. Fluctuations in demand and prices. 4. Credit risk a. Risk of bad debts"
"Arm’s Length Price 101 Nature of risks Particulars 5. Foreign exchange risk a. Risk on account of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates 6. Capacity utilisation risk a. Risks on account of under-utilisation of capacity 5.29 It is important to align the ability to control and manage risk based on the actual activities. One cannot bear the risk contractually if there is no ability to control and manage such a risk. For example: A Co cannot be considered to be assuming risks in a scenario where it does not have the ability to control the decisions that lead to arising of such risks or it does not have financial wherewithal to withstand the loss arising from such risks. 5.30 Further, sometimes the risk profile within the AEs may be contractual and also backed by substance and it might be difficult to identify third parties with identical risk profile. For example: Capacity utilisation risk might not be borne by the customer in a third party scenario which might be the case in the transaction with the AE. In such a situation, adjustment for difference in risks should be considered for comparability and arm’s length price computation purposes. Characterisation 5.31 Characterisation is the process of assessing and determining the nature of the transacting entity (in a given international transaction or specified domestic transaction) as a licensed manufacturer / contract manufacturer / entrepreneur distributor / low risk distributor etc., based on the functional analysis which facilitates the process of selection of the tested party which in turn assists in the  choice of the most appropriate method and also in the identification of the uncontrolled transactions for comparability purposes. 5.32 Characterisation of the related parties is an important component to a transfer pricing analysis and is used as the foundation in conducting the economic analysis. Characterisation of an entity (for transfer pricing purposes) refers to the process by which an entity is classified in a particular category based on the analysis of the functions, assets and risks of the said entity. For eg. based on an analysis of the functions, assets and risks of a given entity it could be classified as a manufacturer (entrepreneur, contract, toll etc.) or as a distributor (entrepreneur, normal risk, low risk etc.) or as a service provider."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  102 5.33 In a typical scenario, a manufacturer and a distributor can be characterised as follows:- a) Manufacturing set-up Having regard to illustrative functions / risk / asset, the manufacturer could be characterized as follows: Parameters Full Fledge Manufacturer Licensed Manufacturer Contract Manufacturer Toll Manufacturer Produces on Own behalf Own behalf Principal Principal Intellectual Property Owns the IP Does not own the IP but uses the IP owned by Principal on license basis Does not own  Does not own Materials Owns Owns Owns Does not own Production scheduling Does for own Does for own Done by Principal Done by Principal Selling and distribution function Performs Performs Does not perform Does not perform Bears market risk Yes Yes Limited Limited Bears inventory risk Yes Yes Limited No Bears capacity utilisation risk Yes Yes No No Bears credit risk Yes Yes No No"

However, for the application of Cost plus Method, Resale Price Method or Transactional Net Margin Method, it is necessary to choose one of the parties to the transaction as the tested party whose profitability needs to be tested (i.e. mark-up on costs, gross margin, or net profit margins) and compare the profitability of the tested party’s transactions with uncontrolled internal or external comparables, as the case may be. On the other hand, profit split method, may require combination of one sided or two-sided method depending upon methodology used. 5.35 The choice of the tested party should be consistent with the functional analysis of the transaction, and the characterisation of the entities. 5.36 The tested party generally would be the less complex party to the controlled transaction and should be the party in respect of which most reliable data for comparability is available. It may be possible that the tested party could be the group entity (AE) which is party to the transaction. To illustrate, say in a transaction pertaining to the sale of goods by a US company (an entrepreneur and owner of significant Intellectual Property) to its India subsidiary (a limited risk distributor), the Indian entity should be selected as the tested party since its functions are less complex as compared to the US company and data of comparable distributors will be more easily available for the purpose of benchmarking."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  104 5.37 While making such an analysis, even the foreign entity could also be selected as the tested party. For instance where an Indian entrepreneur sells goods to its US subsidiary which acts as a low risk distributor, the US entity should be selected as the tested party. In such scenarios, the members should check if detailed information / analysis is maintained by the Company. Contractual terms 5.38 The important contractual terms of the transactions should be ascertained to determine whether transactions as well as the transaction pricing / margin are comparable or not. Some of the contractual terms that need to be examined are: • terms of delivery • CIF, C&F, FOB  • terms of payment • discount, if any • credit period • warranty period • installation services 5.39 An example of how contractual terms may affect transfer pricing may be seen in the following example, which has been taken from Para B.2.3.2.7 of the United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries (2017). “Consider Company A in one country, an agricultural exporter, which regularly buys transportation services from Company B (its foreign subsidiary) to ship its product, cocoa beans, from Company A’s country to overseas markets. Company B occasionally provides transportation services to Company C, an unrelated domestic corporation in the same country as Company B. However, the provision of such services to Company C accounts for only 10 per cent of the gross revenues of Company B and the remaining 90 per cent of Company B’s revenues are attributable to the provision of transportation services for cocoa beans to Company A. In determining the degree of comparability between Company B’s uncontrolled transaction with Company C and its controlled transaction with Company A, the difference in volumes involved in the two transactions, volume discount if any, and the regularity with which these services are provided must be taken"
"Arm’s Length Price 105 into account where such factors would have a material effect on the price charged.” 5.40 It should be noted that in practice, information concerning the contractual terms of potentially comparable uncontrolled transactions may not be available, particularly where external comparables are used for the analysis. The effect of deficiencies in the information in establishing comparability will differ depending on the type of transaction being examined and the transfer pricing method applied. 5.41 Further, the revised OECD Transfer pricing guidelines, 2017 provides for a vigilant approach for testing the arm’s length nature of an international transaction by not just evaluating the on-paper agreement or the contractual terms, but also by scrutinizing the actual business conduct of the transacting parties, the commercial viability of the transaction, the practical feasibility considered by geographical locations, employment of assets, assumption of risks, etc. 5.42 The following example from Para 1.44 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2017) illustrates the concept of clarifying and supplementing the written contractual terms based on the identification of the actual commercial or financial relations. “Company P is the parent company of an MNE group situated in Country P. Company S, situated in Country S, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company P and acts as an agent for Company P’s branded products in the Country S market. The agency contract between Company P and Company S is silent about any marketing and advertising activities in Country S that the parties should perform. Analysis of other economically relevant characteristics and in particular the functions performed, determines that Company S launched an intensive media campaign in Country S in order to develop brand awareness. This campaign represents a significant investment for Company S. Based on evidence provided by the conduct of the parties, it could be concluded that the written contract may not reflect the full extent of the commercial or financial relations between the parties. Accordingly, the analysis should not be limited by the terms recorded in the written contract, but further evidence should be sought as to the conduct of the parties, including as to the basis upon which Company S undertook the media campaign.” 5.43 To the extent possible, adjustments should be attempted to even out the difference between the comparables and the tested party. In the event such adjustments are not possible or where the situation requires too many adjustments, the reliability of the method used as well as the analysis"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  106 performed may require a revisit and probably it would be relevant to use an alternate method. Market conditions 5.44 The market conditions in which uncontrolled transactions and international transactions [or the specified domestic transaction] are conducted must be evaluated to judge their comparability. Some of the different market conditions are: • geographical location and size • regulatory laws and government orders • cost of labour and capital • level of competition • nature of market whether wholesale/retail • overall economic development 5.45 Many of the above conditions are not amenable to reasonably accurate adjustments. The market conditions would be more relevant in determining the comparability only and therefore, unless transactions take place in the same market conditions, they will not be comparable. 5.46 An example of impact of the aforesaid differences is provided below: The taxpayer is engaged in the manufacturing and trading of pharmaceutical products. The taxpayer has sold Product A to its AE in Thailand and also to a third party in Vietnam. The details are provided below: Particulars Sale to an AE Sale to a third party Country Thailand Vietnam Quantity exported 30,000 1,000 Average selling price per unit (in USD) 10 20 Usage Wholesale Trading Retail Trading Prima facie, one may say that the sale of Product A to the AE in Thailand is not at arm’s length since the same product has been sold to a third party in Vietnam at a much higher price. However, one has to analyse the following factors before arriving at a conclusion:"
"Arm’s Length Price 107 a) Geographical differences, market conditions and size of the markets The price at which a product is sold in one country cannot be compared with the price at which the same product is sold in another country because of the impact on account of geographical differences i.e. country specific demand/ supply factors, market conditions, regulations and government orders in force, level of competition, availability of substitute products, consumer purchasing power, etc. which could have a bearing on the price. b) Volume It is essential to evaluate the impact of the difference in volumes transacted with an AE and an independent third party respectively and accordingly make a suitable adjustment to eliminate the difference. For instance, in the above example, the quantity exported to the AE is 30,000 units vis-à-vis 1,000 to the third party. In an arm’s length scenario, any third party would ideally ask for a volume discount. Therefore, unless it is demonstrated that the volume has no impact on the pricing of the transaction under consideration, an appropriate adjustment should be made. c) Laws and government orders in force The Government orders which are prevalent in Thailand and Vietnam would also be relevant and may need to be examined. d) Level of market Export prices of the same product sold to an AE and a third party respectively are bound to be different if the AE and the third party are at different levels of market in the entire value chain. In other words, in the above example, the AE operates as a wholesale trader which is the second level in the entire value chain whereas the third party operates as a retail trader which is the third level in the entire value chain. As stated above, it would be critical to evaluate if reliably accurate adjustment on account of the aforesaid differences could be made to eliminate the differences, and in the absence of such an adjustment the transaction cannot be considered as comparable. Business strategies, commercial considerations and economic principles 5.47 Economic principles and prevailing business conditions are fundamental to any transfer pricing evaluation. Therefore, business"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  108 strategies adopted by enterprises and market conditions faced by taxpayers are relevant factors for determining comparability with uncontrolled transactions/margins, and must be carefully considered during the comparability analysis. While the Indian TP regulations do not specifically recognize / provide for analysis of the business strategies, the OECD Guidelines duly recognize the need to analyse the business strategies while undertaking the comparability analysis. Some examples where business strategies/ economic realities could be relevant are: • market strategies such as entry strategies, market penetration, loss leadership etc. followed by some companies may result in losses in the initial /interim years, as a part of a bigger strategy of building market share and reaping subsequent benefits therefrom. • In case of start up operations, enterprises are generally not able to recover their initial set-up costs etc. during the initial few years of operations. It is not appropriate in such cases to compare the taxpayers profit/ margins with the margins earned by established comparables that are at a different stage of operations. 5.48 It is not necessary that all the criteria specified in Rule 10B(2) should be cumulatively applied while selecting comparable transactions. The relevance of these criteria depends on the method chosen as most appropriate method. For instance, when CUP is chosen as the most appropriate method, the nature of the property and service, the functions performed, risk undertaken and the terms of contract become critical in choosing the comparable transaction. It can generally be stated that criteria mentioned in rule 10B(2) need to be applied with more rigour when comparability is done at transactional level. But when the comparability is done at enterprise level, it becomes difficult to apply the criteria like contractual terms, nature of products or services etc. In other words, a rigorous analysis of functions performed, assets used and risk taken (FAR) is difficult when enterprise level comparisons are made in CPM, RPM, TNMM or PSM. 5.49 The above analysis is carried out to determine whether the uncontrolled transactions and international transactions or specified domestic transaction are comparable. Rule 10B(3) states that an uncontrolled transaction shall be comparable to an international transaction or specified domestic transaction if:"
"Arm’s Length Price 109 (i) none of the differences between transactions or enterprises are likely to materially affect the price or cost charged or paid in or profit arising from, such transactions in the open market; or (ii) reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate material effects of differences. 5.50 If there are no differences, the transactions are comparable straight away. If the differences can be adjusted with reasonable accuracy, then the transactions are comparable, subject to adjustments. If, however, the differences cannot be adjusted with reasonable accuracy, the transactions are to be ignored and the search for comparable transactions would need to commence all over again. For instance, under TNMM where margins are to be compared, the margin of a 1,000crore company cannot be compared with that of a 10 crore company. The two most obvious reasons are the size of the two companies and the relative economies of scale under which they operate. The fact that they operate in the same market on a “level playing field” may not make them comparable enterprises. Some of the other factors/ criteria which could be considered for the purpose of comparability analysis, in order to identify the uncontrolled transactions are: • level of fixed assets as a percentage of total sales, level of operating expenses as a percentage of sales; • level of investment in intangible assets; and • differences in the level of risks assumed by the parties viz. market risk, human resources, quality, contract risk, credit/ collection risks etc. 5.51 It is important to note that the transactions entered into by AEs with unrelated party (“internal comparables”) would provide more reliable and accurate data as compared to transactions by and between third parties (“external comparables”).OECD’s Guidelines on Transfer Pricing recognize the fact that external comparables are difficult to obtain and, also, it may be incomplete and difficult to interpret. Hence for these reasons, internal comparables are preferred to external comparables. 5.52 To illustrate say, the controlled transaction involves the sale of watches by AE1, a watch manufacturer in Country1, to AE2, a watch importer in Country 2, which purchases, imports and resells the watches to unrelated watch dealers in Country 2."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  110  In the above example, one can identify the following comparable transactions (assuming the characteristics of the products are same in all the scenarios) (a) Internal comparables The price charged for watches sold in a comparable uncontrolled transaction between AE 1and Unrelated Party C (i.e. transaction #1); The price charged for watches sold in a comparable uncontrolled transaction between AE 2and Unrelated Party A (i.e. transaction #2) (b) External comparables The price paid for watches sold in a comparable uncontrolled transaction between Unrelated Party A and Unrelated Party B (i.e. transaction #3) 5.53 The analysis of the uncontrolled transactions is made to assess their comparability with the international transaction or specified domestic transaction. 5.54 A question arises as to what should be the number of comparable uncontrolled transactions to be selected. In other words, is it sufficient to have just one CUT or is it necessary that a reasonable number of CUTs should be selected? Both the Act and the Rules do not prescribe the number of CUTs to be chosen. An analysis of section 92C(2) read with the proviso thereto and Rule 10B(1) would show that selection of even one CUT is permissible. The proviso to section 92C(2) uses the expression “provided"
"Arm’s Length Price 111 that where more than one price is determined by the most appropriate method.....”. This indicates that selection of multiple CUTs is not required as a rule and if an assessee adopts multiple CUTs the proviso would be applicable. This is further strengthened by the language adopted in Rule 10B(1) which clearly permits adoption of even a single CUT. For example, Rule 10B(1)(a)(i) uses the expression “......in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of such transactions...” (emphasis supplied). Similar expression is used in other clauses of Rule 10B(1). It is possible to have a single most appropriate CUT. Therefore, it may be said that if one most appropriate CUT is selected, such CUT would represent ALP. However, if more than one CUT is available the proviso to section 92C(2) would be applicable. 5.55 Rule 10B(4) provides that the data to be used in analysing the comparability of an uncontrolled transaction with an international transaction [or a specified domestic transaction] shall be the data relating to the financial year in which the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] has been entered into. Within the same financial year, the CUT may precede or succeed an international transaction. 5.56 The proviso to Rule 10B(4), further states that data relating to a period of not more than 2 years preceding such financial year may also be considered, if such data reveals facts which could have an influence on the determination of the transfer prices in relation to transactions being compared. Multiple year data has been permitted to be used vide Finance (No. 2) Act 2014.CBDT vide Notification No. 83/2015 has issued detailed guidance on the use of the multiple year data for the purpose of comparability analysis. Discussion on the same is detailed in Chapter 1 of this publication. 5.57 Further, the OECD in its Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2017) in Para 3.76 to 3.79 also supports the use of multiple year data. It states that in order to obtain a complete understanding of the facts and circumstances surrounding the controlled transaction, it generally might be useful to examine data from both the year under examination and prior years. The analysis of such information might disclose facts that may have influenced (or should have influenced) the determination of the transfer price. For example, the use of data from past years will show whether a taxpayer's reported loss on a transaction is part of a history of losses on similar transactions, the result of particular economic conditions in a prior year that increased costs in the subsequent year, or a reflection of the fact that a"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961  112 product is at the end of its life cycle. Such an analysis may be particularly useful where a transactional profit method is applied. Multiple year data can also improve the understanding of long-term arrangements. Multiple year data will also be useful in providing information about the relevant business and product life cycles of the comparables. Differences in business or product life cycles may have a material effect on transfer pricing conditions that needs to be assessed in determining comparability. The data from earlier years may show whether the independent enterprise engaged in a comparable transaction was affected by comparable economic conditions in a comparable manner, or whether different conditions in an earlier year materially affected its price or profit so that it should not be used as a comparable. Multiple year data can also improve the process of selecting third party comparables for example by identifying results that may indicate a significant variance from the underlying comparability characteristics of the controlled transaction being reviewed, in some cases leading to the rejection of the comparable, or to detect anomalies in third party information. 5.58 The Other Method (OM) offers more flexibility and permits comparison by use of a “price which has been charged or paid, or would have been charged or paid” thereby allowing use of bonafide quotations, bids, proposals as comparable transactions or prices, and also economic and commercially justifiable models and similar approaches. Power of Assessing Officer 5.59 According to section 92C(3), the Assessing Officer may himself proceed to determine the arm’s length price if any of the following conditions are satisfied:  (i) the price charged or paid in an international transaction or specified domestic transaction has not been determined on the basis of the most appropriate method. (ii) any information and document relating to an international transaction or specified domestic transaction has not been kept and maintained as mandated. (iii) the information or data used in computation of the arm’s length price is not reliable or correct. (iv) the assessee had failed to furnish, within the specified time, any information or document which he was required to furnish."
"Arm’s Length Price 113 5.60 If any of the above conditions are satisfied, the power to determine the arm’s length price may be exercised in any proceeding for the assessment of income. The Assessing Officer also, is required to determine the arm’s length price in accordance with section 92C(1) and (2) only, which states that the arm’s length price will have to be arrived at on the basis of the most appropriate method. The Assessing Officer may determine the arm’s length price on the basis of the material or information or document available with him. Even where such determination is made by the Assessing Officer, if more than one price may be determined by the most appropriate methods, the arm’s length price shall be taken to be arithmetical mean of such prices. 5.61 The information, which the assessee may be called upon to furnish, in the absence of which the Assessing Officer would have power to substitute the arm’s length price, should be that which the assessee has in his possession and is capable of being furnished. 5.62 The substitution of the arm’s length price by the Assessing Officer shall be preceded by an opportunity of hearing being given to the assessee to show cause why such substitution of the arm’s length price should not be made. 5.63 When the Assessing Officer substitutes the arm’s length price on the basis of material or information or document in his possession, he may accordingly re-compute the total income of the assesse .No deduction under section 10A or 10B or Chapter VIA shall be allowed in respect of the amount of income by which the total income of the assessee is enhanced. The restriction on the admissibility of an exemption / deduction is only under sections 10A or 10AA or 10B or Chapter VI-A. It appears that deduction under section 10C may be available on the enhanced income. 5.64 The income of one of the AEs may be recomputed by substituting the actual price paid/charged to another AE for any property or service with the arm’s length price. When this substitution takes place it results in a re-computation of the total income of such AE. This re-computation would, however, not entitle the other AE to demand a re-computation of its total income. Consequently, it would not be entitled to a refund of any tax. For example, if XYZ Ltd. has paid royalty of INR 100 to its AE ABC Ltd., it would have deducted INR 20 as tax under section 115A read with section 195 and remitted the balance of INR 80 to ABC Ltd. If the Assessing Officer computes the arm’s length price of royalty to be INR 75 and substitutes it for the actual amount paid, i.e. INR 100, ABC Ltd., will not able to demand either a re-"

Further, section 92CA(2B) inserted by Finance Act 2012 with retrospective effect from 1stJune 2002 provides that where an assessee has not furnished an accountant’s report under section 92E and an international transaction comes to the notice of the Transfer Pricing Officer, then such international transaction can be examined by the Transfer Pricing Officer as if it was referred to him."
"Chapter 6 Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price Meaning of relevant terms 6.1 The various methods of computation of arm’s length price are prescribed in Rule 10B.For this purpose, certain terms are defined in Rule 10A as under: Rule 10A - Meaning of expressions used in computation of arm’s length price. For the purposes of this rule and rules 10AB to 10E- (a) ‘uncontrolled transaction’ means a transaction between enterprises other than AEs, whether resident or non-resident; (b) ‘property’ includes goods, articles or things, and intangible property; (c) ‘service’ includes financial services; and (d) ‘transaction’ includes a number of closely linked transactions. Further, Section 92F(v) of the Act defines the term ‘transaction’ as below: ‘Transaction’ includes an arrangement, understanding or action in concert - (A)   whether or not such arrangement, understanding or action is formal or in writing; or (B)  whether or not such arrangement, understanding or action is intended to be enforceable by legal proceeding. 6.2 Rule 10B stipulates the methods of determination of arm’s length price. The relevant portion of the rule dealing with each of the methods prescribed is extracted here below and suitable explanations thereof are given along with illustrations encompassing several adjustments for enabling better understanding of the principles involved and the type of working called for."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 116 Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method (CUP Method) 6.3 Rule 10B(1)(a) - Comparable uncontrolled price method, by which,- (i) the price charged or paid for property transferred or services provided in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of such transactions, is identified; (ii) such price is adjusted to account for differences, if any, between the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] and the comparable uncontrolled transactions or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect the price in the open market; (iii) the adjusted price arrived at under sub-clause (ii) is taken to be an arm’s length price in respect of the property transferred or services provided in the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]. 6.4 The comparable uncontrolled price method is considered as one of the traditional transaction methods of determining the arm’s length price. Two other traditional transaction methods are the Resale Price Method and the Cost Plus Method. 6.5 Typical transactions in respect of which the comparable uncontrolled price method may be adopted are: (a) Transfer of goods; (b) Provision of services; (c) Royalty for use of Intangibles; (d) Interest on loans. 6.6 The OECD in its Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2022) observes as under: Para 2.14 “The CUP method compares the price charged for property or services transferred in a controlled transaction to the price charged for property or services transferred in a comparable uncontrolled transaction in comparable circumstances. If there is any difference between the two prices, this may indicate that the condition of the"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 117 commercial and financial relations of the AEs are not at arm's length, and that the price in the uncontrolled transaction may need to be substituted for the price in the controlled transaction.” 6.7 Comparable uncontrolled transactions which involve a transaction between one of the enterprises and an uncontrolled party, are referred to as internal comparables. Comparable uncontrolled transactions which involve a transaction between two parties, neither of which is an associated enterprise, are called external comparables. 6.8 Further, OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2022) has additionally incorporated the application of quoted prices under the CUP methodology while establishing arm’s length nature of commodities’ transfer between AEs. The guidelines have broadened the applicability of the CUP method and have alleviated the arm’s length determination for commodity transactions. Para 2.19 of the guidelines asserts, “Under the CUP method, the arm’s length price for commodity transactions may be determined by reference to comparable uncontrolled transactions and by reference to comparable uncontrolled arrangements represented by the quoted price”. The following para are also relevant: Para 2.20: For the CUP method to be reliably applied to commodity transactions, the economically relevant characteristics of the controlled transaction and the uncontrolled transactions or the uncontrolled arrangements represented by the quoted price need to be comparable. For commodities, the economically relevant characteristics include, among others, the physical features and quality of the commodity; the contractual terms of the controlled transaction, such as volumes traded, period of the arrangements, the timing and terms of delivery, transportation, insurance, and foreign currency terms. For some commodities, certain economically relevant characteristics (e.g. prompt delivery) may lead to a premium or a discount. If the quoted price is used as a reference for determining the arm’s length price or price range, the standardised contracts which stipulate specifications on the basis of which commodities are traded on the exchange and which result in a quoted price for the commodity may be relevant. Where there are differences between the conditions of the controlled transaction and the conditions of the uncontrolled transactions or the conditions determining the quoted"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 118 price for the commodity that materially affect the price of the commodity transactions being examined, reasonably accurate adjustments should be made to ensure that the economically relevant characteristics of the transactions are comparable. 2.23: A particularly relevant factor for commodity transactions determined by reference to the quoted price is the pricing date, which refers to the specific time, date or time period (e.g. a specified range of dates over which an average price is determined) selected by the parties to determine the price for commodity transactions. 6.9 The steps involved in the application of this method are: (i) Identify the price charged or paid in comparable uncontrolled transactions;  (ii) The above price should be adjusted for transaction level differences on the basis of functions performed, assets used and risks taken (FAR) analysis and enterprise level differences if any; (iii) The adjusted price is the arm’s length price; 6.10  On the aspect of comparability for application of the CUP method, the United Nations (‘UN’) in its Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries (2021) has observed as under: “B.4.2.2.3. Product comparability should be closely examined in applying the CUP Method. A price may be materially influenced by differences between the goods or services transferred in the controlled and uncontrolled transactions. The CUP Method is appropriate especially in cases where an independent enterprise buys or sells products that are identical or very similar to those sold in the controlled transaction or in situations where services are rendered that are identical or very similar to those rendered in the controlled transaction. B.4.2.2.4. Although product comparability is important in applying the CUP Method, the other comparability factors should not be disregarded. Contractual terms and economic conditions are also important comparability factors. Where there are differences between controlled and uncontrolled transactions, adjustments should be made to enhance reliability”."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 119 6.11 Given that the CUP Method compares the prices of the products, it is warranted that high degree of similarity on all aspects (such as products / services, terms of the transaction etc.) be established between the products being compared. The UN in the Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries (2021) observes as under: B.4.2.2.5 Reasonably accurate adjustment may be made for differences in: • The type and quality of the products. (E.g. unbranded Kenyan coffee beans as compared with unbranded Brazilian coffee beans); • Delivery terms. (e.g.AE 1 sells similar bicycles to AE 2 and Unrelated Party C. All relevant information on the controlled and uncontrolled transactions is available to AE1, and hence it is probable that all material differences between the transactions can be recognized. The uncontrolled price can be adjusted for the difference in delivery terms to eliminate the effect of this difference on the price); • Volume of sales and related discounts. (E.g.AE 1 sells 5000 bicycles to AE 2 for US$90 per bicycle, while it sells 1000 similar bicycles to Unrelated Party C. The effect of the differences in volume on price should be analysed, and if the effect is material, adjustments should be made perhaps based on volume discounts in similar markets); • Product characteristics. (E.g. the uncontrolled transactions to an unrelated party involve bicycles on which modifications have been made. However, the bicycles sold in the controlled transactions do not include these modifications. If the product modifications have a material effect on price, then the uncontrolled price should be adjusted to take into account this difference in price); • Contractual terms. (E.g. AE 1 sells the bicycles to AE 2 offering a 90 day credit term but the contract terms dictate that all sales to Unrelated Party C are Cash On Delivery); • Risk incurred. (E.g. AE 1 is exposed to inventory risk related to sales by AE 2 and the risk that customers of AE 2 will default on their bicycle purchase loans; whereas in the transaction between AE 1 and Unrelated Party C, the latter is exposed to the inventory risk and the risk of its customers’ default. This difference in risk allocation must be analysed and its effect on price quantified before AE 2’s prices and Unrelated Party C’s prices can be considered comparable); and"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 120 • Geographical factors. (E.g. AE 1 sells bicycles to AE 2 located in South Africa, while Unrelated Party C, to which it also sells the same bicycles, is located in Egypt. The only material difference that could be identified between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions concerns the locale. To perform adjustments to account for this difference one might have to consider, for example, differences in inflation rates between South Africa and Egypt, the competitiveness of the bicycle market in the two countries and differences in government regulations if relevant). B.4.2.2.6. Reasonably accurate adjustments may not be possible for: • Unique and valuable trademarks. (E.g. assuming AE 1 is engaged in manufacturing high value branded goods, and attaches its valuable trademark to the goods transferred in the controlled transaction, while uncontrolled transaction concerns the transfer of goods that are not branded. The effect of the trademark on the price of a watch may be material. However, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to adjust for effect of the trademark on price since the trademark is an intangible asset that is unique. If reasonably accurate adjustments cannot be made to account for a material product difference the CUP Method may not be the appropriate method for the transaction); and • Fundamental differences in the products. (E.g. if the products being sold are significantly different from the products sold in the proposed comparable transaction it may not be possible to adjust for the product differences). In such events, CUP method should not be used for the purpose of the analysis. B.4.2.2.7. Notwithstanding the difficulties often associated with adjustments to address the sources of non-comparability described above, the need to make adjustments should not automatically prevent the use of the CUP Method. It is often possible to perform reasonably accurate adjustments. If reasonable adjustments cannot be performed the reliability of the CUP Method is decreased. In these circumstances another transfer pricing method may be more appropriate."
Examples where it may not be possible to make reasonably accurate adjustments are given below:
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 121 • Difference in the position of the entity in the value chain: (E.g.AE 1 sells bicycles to AE 2 as also to Unrelated Party C. Further, AE 2, after purchasing the bicycles from AE 1 sells the same bicycles to Unrelated Party D.  When the bicycles are sold by AE 1 to Unrelated Party C, they are sold to the final customers for their own use, whereas the bicycles sold to AE 2, are not for the use of AE 2, but for further sales to Unrelated Party D.   From the above, it can be seen that there is an added level in the entire value chain, when the sales are to AE 2 vis-a-vis the sales made by AE 1 to Unrelated Party C. The position of an entity in the value chain impacts the price at which a product is sold due to the additional functions that may be performed by the said entity. In such a case, it may not be possible to compare the transaction of sale of bicycles by AE 1 to Unrelated Party C with the transaction of sale by AE 2 to Unrelated Party D, due to the unavailability of accurate and reliable data pertaining to the margin earned by AE 1 from the sales to Unrelated Enterprise C. • Difference in the characterization of the entity: (E.g. AE 1 is a captive manufacturer engaged in the manufacturing of bicycles for AE 2. AE 2 is a full fledge distributor engaged in the distribution of the bicycles to the customers. The pricing for the sale made by AE 2 to the customers is governed by the prevailing market conditions. In such a case, it may not be possible to compare the transaction of sale of bicycles by AE 1 to AE 2 with the transaction of sale of bicycles by AE 2 to the customers, due to the differences in the functions performed, assets employed and the risks undertaken by   AE1 and AE 2 and the consequent difference in their characterisation and position in the value chain with respect to the transaction of sale of bicycles.)"

(iv) INR 20 representing a quantity discount - This is for the reason that if similar discount had been offered to M Ltd., the effective price to M Ltd., would have been less. Computation of arm’s length price under the comparable uncontrolled price method The following points are to be noticed:  (i) All adjustments in the course of applying this method are to be made to the price charged in the uncontrolled transaction. The presence or absence of any specific features in the uncontrolled transaction as compared to the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] is to be adjusted for. These features are to be evaluated in monetary terms. This is a subjective process based on objective facts. (ii) Only differences that would materially affect the price in the open market are required to be adjusted. Two points may be noted. Firstly, materiality would have to be judged in the light of various circumstances. If there are numerous adjustments, which are individually not material but collectively material, the necessary adjustments are required to be made. Secondly, the term ‘open market’, though not defined, would mean a transaction between a knowledgeable and a willing purchaser and a knowledgeable and willing seller where neither of them is influenced or compelled to act in a particular manner. Resale Price Method (RPM) 6.13 Rule 10B(1)(b) resale price method, by which,- (i) The price at which property purchased or services obtained by the enterprise from an AE is resold or are provided to an unrelated enterprise, is identified; (ii) such resale price is reduced by the amount of a normal gross profit margin accruing to the enterprise or to an unrelated enterprise from the purchase and resale of the same or similar property or from obtaining and providing the same or similar"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 125 services, in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of such transactions; (iii) the price so arrived at is further reduced by the expenses incurred by the enterprise in connection with the purchase of property or obtaining of services; (iv) the price so arrived at is adjusted to take into account the functional and other differences, including differences in accounting practices, if any, between the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect the amount of gross profit margin in the open market; (v) the adjusted price arrived at under sub-clause (iv) is taken to be an arm’s length price in respect of the purchase of the property or obtaining of the services by the enterprise from the AE. 6.14 Typical transactions where RPM may be adopted are distribution of goods involving little or no value addition. Also, it is pertinent to note that while CUP method is a two sided method (wherein the said method can be applied using details / data of either of the transacting parties), RPM is a one sided method wherein only the margins earned by one of the transacting party i.e., the distributor, can be analysed / evaluated. 6.15 The OECD in its Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2022) has observed as under: Para 2.35 - An appropriate resale price margin is easiest to determine where the reseller does not add substantially to the value of the product. In contrast, it may be more difficult to use the resale price method to arrive at an arm’s length price where, before resale, the goods are further processed or incorporated into a more complicated product so that their identity is lost or transformed (e.g. where components are joined together in finished or semi-finished goods). Another example where the resale price margin requires particular care is where the reseller contributes substantially to the creation or maintenance of intangible property associated with the product (e.g. trademarks or trade names) which are owned by an AE. In such cases, the contribution of the goods originally transferred to the value of the final product cannot be easily evaluated."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 126 Para 2.36 - A resale price margin is more accurate where it is realised within a short time of the reseller’s purchase of the goods. The more time that elapses between the original purchase and resale the more likely it is that other factors – changes in the market, in rates of exchange, in costs, etc. – will need to be taken into account in any comparison.” 6.16 On application of RPM, the UN in the Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing has observed as under: “4.3.4.3 While product differences may be more acceptable in applying the Resale Price Method as compared to the CUP Method, the property transferred should still be broadly similar in the controlled and uncontrolled transactions. Broad differences are likely to reflect differences in functions performed, and therefore gross margins earned, at arm’s length. 4.3.4.4 Example:  The compensation for a distribution company should be the same whether it sells washing machines or dryers, because the functions performed (including risks assumed and assets used) are similar for the two activities. It should be noted, however, that distributers engaged in the sale of markedly different products cannot be compared. The price of a washing machine will, of course, differ from the price of a dryer, as the two products are not substitutes for each other. Although product comparability is less important under the resale price method, greater product similarity is likely to provide more reliable transfer pricing results. It is not always necessary to conduct a resale price analysis for each individual product line distributed by the sales company. Instead, the resale price method can be applied more broadly, for example based on the gross margin a sales company should earn over its full range of broadly similar products.” From the above, it can be observed that RPM is more tolerant as compared to CUP toward product differences. RPM thus focuses on functional comparability. A similar level of compensation is expected for performing similar functions across different activities."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 127 6.17 The UN in the Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing has explained that RPM can be used even for a commission agent:  4.3.1.5 Other approaches are possible. For example, if the associated enterprise acts as a sales agent that does not take title to the goods, it is possible to use the commission earned by the sales agent (represented as a percentage of the uncontrolled sales price of the goods concerned) as the comparable gross profit margin. 6.18 The steps involved in the application of this method are:  (i) identify the international transaction [or specified domestic transaction] of purchase of property or services; (ii) identify the price at which such property or services are resold or provided to an unrelated party (resale price); (iii) identify the normal gross profit margin in a comparable uncontrolled transaction whether internal or external. The normal gross profit margin is that margin which an enterprise would earn from purchase of the similar product from an unrelated party and the resale of the same to another unrelated party; (iv)  deduct the normal gross profit from the resale price; (v) deduct expenses incurred in connection with the purchase of goods; (vi) adjust the resultant amount for the differences between the uncontrolled transaction and the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]. These differences could be functional and other differences including differences in accounting practices. Further these differences should be such as would materially affect the amount of gross profit margin in the open market; (vii) the price arrived at is the arm’s length price of the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]; 6.19 The application of RPM can be understood with the following example: AE1 Ltd., is an Indian company. The shareholding pattern of AE1 Ltd., is as follows; Shareholder’s name Status % holding AE2 Ltd. Foreign Company 30 AE3 Ltd. Indian Company 30"

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 130 (b) The comparable uncontrolled transaction is the purchase transaction entered into by AE1 Ltd., with K Ltd.  (c) The starting point for arriving at the ALP of such purchase transaction is the resale price charged to A Ltd. viz. INR3,000 [Rule 10B(1)(b)(i)]. (d) From the said resale price, the normal gross profit margin which AE1 Ltd., would earn in a comparable uncontrolled transaction should be reduced. In this example, the actual gross profit margin earned by AE 1 Ltd., in respect of its purchase from K Ltd, and its resale to M Ltd, is 15%. (e) The following adjustments are made to arrive at the normal GP;   Actual gross profit margin with M Ltd. 15%  Less:  1. Difference between Ex-shop and FOR prices 2%  2. Difference due to quantity discount  1%  Normal gross profit margin with M Ltd. 12%  Note: While arriving at normal gross profits from the actual gross profits, only the differences in the sale transactions of AE1 Ltd., with A Ltd., and M Ltd., have been taken. The differences in the purchase transactions of AE 1 Ltd., with AE2 Ltd. and K Ltd., affecting the gross profits are taken separately as provided in sub rule (iv). (f) The resale price of INR3000. to M Ltd., is reduced by the normal gross profit margin of 12%. The resultant cost of sales is INR2640 (i.e. 3000-360) [Rule 10B(1)(b)(ii)]. (g) The cost of sales so arrived at is reduced by the expenses incurred in connection with the purchase (international transaction) i.e. freight of INR 10 and customs duty of INR25. The resultant amount is INR 2605 (i.e. 2640-25-10) [Rule 10B(1)(b)(iii)].

(i) The aforesaid amount of INR 2605 should be increased by INR10 being the freight incurred by AE1Ltd., in the case of purchase from AE2Ltd., but not incurred in case of purchase from K Ltd., This is for the reason that if a similar freight had been paid in respect of transaction with K Ltd, the gross profit margin from K Ltd., would have been lower and the resultant price would have been higher. (j) A decrease by INR15 representing the quantity discount allowed by AE2 Ltd., is to be made. This is for the reason that if a similar discount had been allowed in respect of transaction with K Ltd, the gross profit margin from K Ltd., would have been higher and the resultant price would have been lower.

(ii) In contrast to the CUP Method, the reliability of RPM is influenced by factors that have less effect on the price of a product than on the costs of performing functions. Such differences could affect gross margins [e.g. the composition of Cost of Goods Sold (‘COGS’)]. These factors could include cost structures (e.g. accounting practices), business experience (e.g. start‐up phase or mature business) or management efficiency. (iii)  As provided in Rule 10B(1)(b)(iii), the expenses incurred in connection with the purchase from AE are to be reduced from cost of sales. In RPM, the arm’s length purchase price is arrived at reducing the normal gross profit margin from the resale price as the first step. If the computation is stopped at this step itself, the derived purchase amount would be inclusive of such expenses. It is therefore necessary to reduce such expenses in arriving at the arm’s length purchase price. (iv) Adjustments have to be made also for accounting practices apart from functional and other differences. Differences in accounting practices may be because: (a) sales and purchases have been accounted for inclusive of taxes or exclusive of taxes; (b) method of pricing the goods namely, FOB or CIF; (c) fluctuations in foreign exchange."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 133 (v) The comparability analysis should try to take into account whether the reseller has the exclusive right to resell the goods, because exclusive rights may affect the resale price margin. (vi) In actual practice, the resale in any financial year may be also out of opening stock. Similarly, the goods purchased during the said year may remain in closing stock. Under the RPM, the arm’s length price of purchases from AE during the financial year should be determined. The process of determination under Rule 10B(1)(b) culminates in the cost of sales rather than value of purchase during the year. This ‘cost of sales’ should be converted into ‘value of purchase’. For this purpose, the closing stock of goods purchased from AE should be added and the opening stock of purchases from AE should be deducted. The focus here is to identify cost of goods sold and make adjustment therein rather than amount of purchases only. (vii)  Further, it may not possible to reliably compute the gross margin of the comparables since in India at this point of time there is no uniform accounting convention which is applicable for computing the gross margin. The companies could follow different accounting principles while recording a particular expense item. Hence, it is not possible to ensure that all the expense items have been uniformly accounted by all comparables while computing the gross margin. For example – Reporting of discounts, transportation cost, insurance and warranty cost, valuations of the inventory, etc. As a result, application of RPM using external comparable transaction could be a challenge considering the availability of the reliable data. 6.20 It is important to understand the characterization of the AEs (based on the detailed functional analysis) before one selects RPM as the most appropriate method. This can be explained by way of an example provided below: ABC Inc. owns valuable patents to manufacture the bicycles and has a valuable trade name. ABC Inc.’s subsidiary i.e. ABC Ltd purchases the bicycles from ABC Inc. and resells the bicycles to unrelated dealers in India. The bicycle is new in the Indian market and is not known to the Indian consumers. Further, it is assumed that comparable uncontrolled transactions are not available. The financial data under two scenarios is provided below:"

Ltd (ITA No 16/2014) Ruling by the High Court. • Since the VAE in case 1 is only 5% of the sales, it can be said that the marketing spend needed create customer awareness to facilitate sale of product in the Indian market is borne by ABC Inc. and the VAE incurred by ABC Ltd is with respect to normal selling function. • It should be noted that a foreign entity may be selected as the tested party if it is the less complex entity and if reliable data in respect of the international transaction under consideration is available. • From the above functional analysis, ABC Ltd can be characterised as a normal risk bearing distributor and ABC Inc. is the entrepreneurial"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 135 entity. As seen from the characterisation, ABC Inc. is more complex entity and therefore, it cannot be considered as a tested party. As result, ABC Ltd has been selected as a tested party in this case. • Since comparable uncontrolled transactions are not available, the CUP Method cannot be applied as the most appropriate method. • ABC Ltd is engaged in purchase of bicycles from ABC Inc. are further selling it to a third party without any significant value addition. The gross profit realised by ABC Ltd can be compared using RPM as the most appropriate method in this case. Case 2 • The VAE in case 2 is significant i.e. 25% of the sales. It can be said that ABC Ltd is engaged in developing the marketing intangible in the Indian market for ABC Inc.  • This is the case where the reseller contributes substantially to the creation or maintenance of intangible property associated with the product (e.g. trademarks or trade names) which are owned by an AE. In such cases, the contribution of the goods originally transferred to the value of the final product cannot be easily evaluated. • Further, this activity of brand building may require to be separately evaluated for testing the arm’s length nature. In case the activity of reselling and brand building are inextricably inter linked and cannot be separately evaluated, there may arise a need to evaluate a different method for testing the arm’s length nature of the aforementioned closely linked transactions. • In such cases, RPM may not be the most appropriate method and one has to take recourse to other methods prescribed under the Act. 6.21  Further, one should also evaluate the pricing mechanism, contractual terms, roles and obligations as well as the functional profile of the parties to a transaction, before the determination of the most appropriate method to benchmark the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]. For example – A distributor could be awarded a net profit on sales for performing the routine distribution functions. However, in such a scenario RPM may not be the most appropriate method since RPM takes into account"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 136 the gross margin earned by the distributor. In such a situation, TNMM could be considered as the most appropriate method. Typically, RPM may be the most appropriate method in case of a normal risk distributor, who is awarded a reasonable level of gross margin for the functions performed. Cost Plus Method (CPM) 6.22 Rule 10B(1)(c)cost plus method, by which,- (i) the direct and indirect costs of production incurred by the enterprise in respect of property transferred or services provided to an AE, are determined; (ii) the amount of a normal gross profit mark-up to such costs (computed according to the same accounting norms) arising from the transfer or provision of the same or similar property or services by the enterprise, or by an unrelated enterprise, in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of such transactions, is determined; (iii) the normal gross profit mark-up referred to in sub-clause (ii) is adjusted to take into account the functional and other differences, if any, between the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect such profit mark-up in the open market; (iv) the costs referred to in sub-clause (i) are increased by the adjusted profit mark-up arrived at under sub-clause (iii); (v) the sum so arrived at is taken to be an arm’s length price in relation to the supply of the property or provision of services by the enterprise. 6.23 Typical transactions where CPM may be adopted are: (a) provision of services; (b) joint facility arrangements; (c) transfer of semi finished goods; (d) long term buying and selling arrangements."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 137 6.24 The OECD in its Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2022) states as follows: Para 2.45 “This method probably is most useful where semi finished goods are sold between associated parties, where associated parties have concluded joint facility agreements or long-term buy-and-supply arrangements, or where the controlled transaction is the provision of services.” 2.46 The cost plus mark-up of the supplier in the controlled transaction should ideally be established by reference to the cost plus mark-up that the same supplier earns in comparable uncontrolled transactions (“internal comparable”). In addition, the cost plus mark-up that would have been earned in comparable transactions by an independent enterprise may serve as a guide (“external comparable”). UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries (2021) states as under: 4.4.8.1 The CPM is typically applied in cases involving the intragroup sale of tangible property where the related party manufacturer performs limited manufacturing functions or in the case of intragroup provision of services. The method usually assumes the manufacturer or service provider has low risks, because the level of the costs will then better reflect the value being added and hence the market price. 4.4.8.2 The CPM is also generally used in transactions involving a contract manufacturer, a toll manufacturer or a low risk assembler which does not own product intangibles and assumes little risk. The related customer involved in the controlled transaction will generally be much more complex than the manufacturer (or service provider) in terms of functions performed (e.g. conducting marketing and selling functions, coordination of production and sales, giving instructions to the contract manufacturer about the quantity and quality of production, and purchasing raw materials in some cases), risks assumed (e.g. market risk, credit risk and inventory risk) and assets used or contributed (e.g. product or other intangibles). The contract manufacturer is thus the less complex and as such should be the tested party in the transfer pricing analysis."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 138 4.4.8.3 The CPM is usually not a suitable method to use in transactions involving a fully-fledged manufacturer which owns or develops unique and valuable product intangibles as it will be very difficult to locate independent manufacturers with comparable product intangibles. That is, it will be hard to establish a profit mark-up that is required to remunerate the fully-fledged manufacturer for its unique and valuable intangibles. In a typical transaction structure involving a fully-fledged manufacturer and related sales companies (e.g. commissionaires), the sales companies will normally be the less complex entities involved in the controlled transactions and will therefore be the tested party in the analysis. The RPM is typically more easily applied in such cases Also, it is pertinent to note that similar to RPM, CPM is also a one sided method wherein the margins earned by the manufacturer / service provider can be tested under this method. 6.25 The steps involved in the application of this method are: (i) Determine the direct and indirect cost of production in respect of property transferred or service provided to an   AE. (ii) Identify one or more comparable uncontrolled transactions for same or similar property or service. (iii) Determine normal gross profit mark-up on costs in the comparable uncontrolled transaction. Such costs should be computed according to the same accounting norms. In other words, the components of costs of comparable uncontrolled transaction should be the same as those of international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]. (iv) Adjust the gross profit mark-up to account for functional and other differences between the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] and the comparable uncontrolled transaction. Such adjustments should also be made for enterprise level differences. (v) The direct and indirect cost of production in the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] is increased by such adjusted gross profit mark-up. (vi) The resultant figure is the arm’s length price."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 139 6.26 With respect to CPM, The UN in the Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing states as below: “As with the RPM, and for the same reasons, close similarity of products in the controlled and uncontrolled transactions is less important under the Cost Plus Method than under the CUP Method, while functional comparability (including comparability of risks assumed and assets used) is more important. However, because significant differences in products may necessarily result in significant differences in the functions, the controlled and uncontrolled transactions should ideally involve the manufacturing of products within the same product family. (para 4.4.5.2 ) 6.27 An example on importance of functional similarity is provided below: A Limited is engaged in manufacturing of pet bottles and sales to third party customers in the Indian market. It is also engaged in selling the manufactured pet bottles to the AE outside India. The AE further sells the pet bottles to third party customers in their respective markets. The functional profile of A Limited with respect to sales to third parties in domestic market and AE is provided below: Functions performed Domestic business (Unrelated) Export business (AE) Manufacturing function √ √ Marketing and distribution function √ X After sales support √ X Inventory management √ X  Risks assumed Domestic business Export business Market risk √ X Credit risk √ X Foreign  exchange risk X √ Inventory risk- √ X From the above, one could see that there are differences in the functional profile of A Limited with respect to sales made to third parties in the domestic market and to AEs. Owing to such differences, while CPM can be used for"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 140 analyzing the transaction pertaining to export to the AE (by A Limited), however the gross margins earned by A Limited from such exports cannot be compared with the gross margin earned by A Limited from sale to third party customers in the Indian market. 6.28 The OECD in its Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2022) has stated the following in relation to application of CPM: 2.51 For this purpose, it is particularly important to consider differences in the level and types of expenses – operating expenses and non-operating expenses including financing expenditures – associated with functions performed and risks assumed by the parties or transactions being compared. Consideration of these differences may indicate the following: a) If expenses reflect a functional difference (taking into account assets used and risks assumed) which has not been taken into account in applying the method, an adjustment to the cost plus mark-up may be required. b) If the expenses reflect additional functions that are distinct from the activities tested by the method, separate compensation for those functions may need to be determined. Such functions may for example amount to the provision of services for which an appropriate reward may be determined. Similarly, expenses that are the result of capital structures reflecting non-arm's length arrangements may require separate adjustment. c) If differences in the expenses of the parties being compared merely reflect efficiencies or inefficiencies of the enterprises, as would normally be the case for supervisory, general, and administrative expenses, then no adjustment to the gross margin may be appropriate. 2.55 In principle historical costs should be attributed to individual units of production, although admittedly the cost plus method may overemphasize historical costs. Some costs, for example costs of materials, labour, and transport will vary over a period and in such a case it may be appropriate to average the costs over the period. Averaging also may be appropriate across product groups or over a particular line of production."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 141 Further, averaging may be appropriate with respect to the costs of fixed assets where the production or processing of different products is carried on simultaneously and the volume of activity fluctuates. Costs such as replacement costs and marginal costs also may need to be considered where these can be measured and they result in a more accurate estimate of the appropriate profit. 6.29 The application of CPM can be understood with the following example: AE1 Ltd., is an Indian company. The shareholding pattern of AE1 Ltd., is as follows: Shareholder’s name Status % holding AE2 Ltd. Foreign Company 30 AE3 Ltd. Indian Company 30 Financial Institutions Indian Company 10 Public  30 AE1 Ltd., an unrelated party, develops software for various customers, who include AE2 Ltd. and M Ltd.

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 142 Factors to be considered while determining ALP: (a) In CPM, one has to start with the gross profit mark-up which the enterprise earned in a comparable uncontrolled transaction. In this example, the comparable uncontrolled transaction is between AE1 Ltd., and M Ltd. (b) Such gross profit (GP) markup needs to be adjusted for the following: ➢ As AE1 Ltd., did not receive the technology support from M Ltd., it has priced its services higher resulting in it earning a higher GP with M Ltd.. The value of technology support of INR17,500 received from AE2 Ltd. is 10% of cost. Therefore, the GP with M Ltd., has to be reduced by 10%. ➢ AE1 Ltd. did not provide discount to M Ltd., as volume of business from M Ltd., was not as high as that from AE2 Ltd. Had AE1 Ltd., offered similar discount to M Ltd., the GP with M Ltd., would have been lower. The discount of INR 8,750 offered to AE2 Ltd. is 5% of cost. Therefore, the GP with M Ltd., has to be decreased by 5%. ➢ AE1 Ltd., has incurred INR 13,125 towards marketing functions in respect of its transactions with M Ltd., which is 7.5% of its cost. However, in its transactions with AE2 Ltd. the said functions are assumed by AE2 Ltd. Had AE1 Ltd., not incurred similar expenses with M Ltd., it would have settled for a lower GP. Therefore, the GP with M Ltd., has to be reduced by 7.5%. ➢ The cost of credit of INR 2,625 provided by AE1 Ltd., to AE2 Ltd. is 1.5% of its cost. However, in its transactions with M Ltd., such credit is not provided. Had AE1 Ltd., provided similar credit to M Ltd., it would have increased its price resulting in a higher GP. Therefore, the GP with M Ltd., has to be increased by 1.5%. (c) The resultant gross profit mark-up is the arm’s length gross profit mark up. (d) The costs of AE1 Ltd., in its transactions with AE2 Ltd. should be increased by the arm’s length gross profit mark up to arrive at the arm’s length income."

(B) 2,00,000 Income increases by (A-B) 25,750 6.30 It is also important to note that the cost plus pricing is different from CPM. This could be explained by way of the following example:"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 144 A Limited is a captive service provider working with an assured return of 10% on the total cost incurred in connection with provision of such services to the Group. In this case, one could see that though the pricing is based on the cost plus mark-up, the same cannot itself lead to a conclusion that CPM is the most appropriate method. The costs that A Limited would be recovering from the Group may involve costs incurred below the gross profit level and thus, CPM may not be applicable in such a scenario. The following points are to be noticed: (i) In this method, the direct and indirect costs of production are to be determined. The terms ‘direct’ or ‘indirect’ costs are however not defined. A reference may therefore be made to the industry practice as well as the pronouncements of the ICAI. OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2022) mentions about direct and indirect costs as under:  2.53: While precise accounting standards and terms may vary, in general the costs and expenses of an enterprise are understood to be divisible into three broad categories. First, there are the direct costs of producing a product or service, such as the cost of raw materials. Second, there are indirect costs of production, which although closely related to the production process may be common to several products or services (e.g. the costs of a repair department that services equipment used to produce different products). Finally, there are the operating expenses of the enterprise as a whole, such as supervisory, general, and administrative expenses. 2.54: The distinction between gross and net profit analyses may be understood in the following terms. In general, the cost plus method will use mark ups computed after direct and indirect costs of production, while a net profit method will use profits computed after operating expenses of the enterprise as well. It must be recognised that because of the variations in practice among countries, it is difficult to draw any precise lines between the three categories described above. Thus, for example, an application of the cost plus method may in a particular case include the consideration of some expenses that might be considered operating expenses, as discussed in paragraph 2.52."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 145  2.59: Example of the application of cost plus method  A is a domestic manufacturer of timing mechanisms for mass- market clocks. A sells this product to its foreign subsidiary B. A earns a 5% gross profit mark up with respect to its manufacturing operation. X, Y, and Z are independent domestic manufacturers of timing mechanisms for mass- market watches. X, Y, and Z sell to independent foreign purchasers. X, Y, and Z earn gross profit mark ups with respect to their manufacturing operations that range from 3% to 5%. A accounts for supervisory, general, and administrative costs as operating expenses, and thus these costs are not reflected in cost of goods sold. The gross profit mark ups of X, Y, and Z, however, reflect supervisory, general, and administrative costs as part of costs of goods sold. Therefore, the gross profit mark ups of X, Y, and Z must be adjusted to provide accounting consistency. It may also be noted that determination of direct and indirect cost of manufacturing is not mandated under the mandatory format of financials under the Companies Act. This results in difficulty in applying CPM for the external comparables and therefore, CPM as the most appropriate method may fail. Further, in the Indian scenario, it is not possible to reliably compute the gross margin of the comparables since there is no uniform accounting convention which is applicable for computing the gross margin. The companies could follow different accounting principles while recording a particular expense item. Hence, it is not possible to ensure that all the expense items have been uniformly accounted by all comparables while computing the gross margin. For example – Reporting of R&D costs, valuations of the inventory, etc. As a result, application of CPM using external comparable transaction could be a challenge considering the availability of the reliable data. Further, reliability of CPM may also be adversely affected by factors such as cost structures, business, management efficiency and lack of reliable external comparable data etc. (ii) In determining the direct and indirect cost, the following factors have to be borne in mind:  (a) if the plant has been under utilised the costs may have to be suitably adjusted;"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 146  (b) absorption costing method is normally to be preferred. (iii) This method is to be adopted only in cases of supply of property or services to an AE. This method is not to be applied when the enterprise is in receipt of property or services from an AE. However, in such cases, one may still evaluate the applicability of CPM as the most appropriate method by considering the AE as the tested party. Profit Split Method (PSM) 6.31 Rule 10B(1)(d) profit split method, which may be applicable mainly in international transactions [or specified domestic transactions] involving transfer of unique intangibles or in multiple international transactions [or specified domestic transactions] which are so inter-related that they cannot be evaluated separately for the purpose of determining the arm’s length price of any one transaction, by which- (i) the combined net profit of the AEs arising from the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] in which they are engaged, is determined; (ii) the relative contribution made by each of the AEs to the earning of such combined net profit, is then evaluated on the basis of the function performed, assets employed or to be employed and risks assumed by each enterprise and on the basis of reliable external market data which indicates how such contribution would be evaluated by unrelated enterprises performing comparable functions in similar circumstances; (iii) the combined net profit is then split amongst the enterprises in proportion to their relative contributions, as evaluated under sub-clause (II); (iv) the profit thus apportioned to the assessee is taken into account to arrive at an arm’s length price in relation to the international transaction [or specified domestic transaction]: Provided that the combined net profit referred to in sub-clause (i) may, in the first instance, be partially allocated to each enterprise so as to provide it with a basic return appropriate for the type of international transaction [or specified domestic transaction] in which it is engaged, with reference to market returns achieved for similar types of transactions by independent enterprises, and thereafter, the residual"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 147 net profit remaining after such allocation may be split amongst the enterprises in proportion to their relative contribution in the manner specified under sub-clauses (ii) and (iii), and in such a case the aggregate of the net profit allocated to the enterprise in the first instance together with the residual net profit apportioned to that enterprise on the basis of its relative contribution shall be taken to be the net profit arising to that enterprise from the international transaction [or specified domestic transaction]. 6.32 Typical transactions where the profit-split method may be used are transactions involving: (a) integrated services provided by more than one enterprise for e.g., in case of financial service sector, where the activities performed by Indian company and foreign AEs in relation of a merger and acquisition transaction are so interrelated that it may not possible to segregate them; (b) transfer of unique intangibles, for e.g. two AEs contribute their respective intangibles to develop a new product or process and earn income from such product or process. 6.33 The observations of the OECD, in its Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2022), on this method are as follows: 2.114 The transactional profit split method seeks to establish arm’s length outcomes or test reported outcomes for controlled transactions in order to approximate the results that would have been achieved between independent enterprises engaging in a comparable transaction or transactions. The method first identifies the profits to be split from the controlled transactions—the relevant profits—and then splits them between the associated enterprises on an economically valid basis that approximates the division of profits that would have been agreed at arm’s length. As is the case with all transfer pricing methods, the aim is to ensure that profits of the associated enterprises are aligned with the value of their contributions and the compensation which would have been agreed in comparable transactions between independent enterprises for those contributions. The transactional profit split method is particularly useful when the compensation to the associated enterprises can be more reliably valued by reference to the relative shares of their"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 148 contributions to the profits arising in relation to the transaction(s) than by a more direct estimation of the value of those contributions. 2.115 References to “profits” should be taken as applying equally to losses. 6.34 Determining the combined profits to be split In this regard, the OECD in its Transfer Pricing Guidelines (2022) observes as under: 2.130 The combined profits to be split in a transactional profit split method are the profits of the associated enterprises from the controlled transactions in which the associated enterprises are engaged. The combined profits to be split should only be those arising from the controlled transaction(s) under review. In determining those profits, it is essential to first identify the relevant transactions to be covered by the transactional profit split. Where a taxpayer has controlled transactions with more than one associated enterprise, it is also necessary to identify the parties in relation to those transactions and the profits to be split among them. 2.131 In order to determine the combined profits to be split, the accounts of the parties to the transaction to which a transactional profit split is applied need to be put on a common basis as to accounting practice and currency and then combined. Because accounting standards can have significant effects on the determination of the profits to be split, accounting standards should be selected in advance of applying the method and applied consistently over the lifetime of the arrangement. 2.133 If the profit split method were to be used by associated enterprises to set transfer pricing in controlled transactions (i.e. an ex ante approach), then each associated enterprise would seek to achieve the division of profits that independent enterprises would have expected to realize from engaging in comparable transactions. Depending on the facts and circumstances, profit splits using either actual or projected profits are observed in practice. 6.35 There are two approaches to this method, namely, total profits split and residual profit split."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 149 6.36 Total profits split: The steps involved are as follows: (i) Determine the combined net profit of the AEs arising from the international transactions [or the specified domestic transaction] in which they are engaged. Such profits represent the profits earned from third parties due to the combined efforts of the AEs. It may be noted that the ‘combined net profit’ referred to in the rule is not the aggregate of entire profits earned by the AEs. Example:AE1 may earn profits from certain transactions wherein there is no contribution by AE2and vice versa. Such profits do not enter into the determination of combined net profit. Only those profits that are earned as a result of joint efforts of AE1 and AE2 should be taken as combined net profit. (ii) Evaluate relative contribution made by each entity involved in the transaction on the basis of:   (a)  functions performed;  (b)  assets employed;  (c)  risks assumed;  (d)  the reliable external market data indicating how such contribution would be evaluated by unrelated enterprises performing comparable functions in similar circumstances. It may be noted that reference to ‘external market data’ indicates comparable uncontrolled transactions. The use of word ‘external’ does not preclude use of internal CUT. In the process of choosing CUTs, the function performed, assets used and risks taken (FAR) of the uncontrolled transactions would have been compared with the FAR of the international transactions [or the specified domestic transaction].When the FAR of the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] and CUT are similar, the relative contribution adopted in the CUT should be applied to the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]. Any significant differences between the two should be suitably adjusted. (iii) Thereafter, split the combined net profit in proportion to the relative contribution determined as above. (iv) The profit so apportioned is taken to arrive at the arm’s length price in relation to the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]. The profits so apportioned to the AE when added to the"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 150 costs incurred by it in relation to international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] would result in arm’s length price. Residual profit split approach 6.37 In this approach, firstly, a basic return is determined for each of the enterprises and profits of each such enterprise is ascertained. This amount is reduced from the combined net profits. Residual profits are allocated on the basis of relative contribution. Steps involved in this approach are as follows: (i) Determine the combined net profit of the AEs arising from the international transactions [or the specified domestic transaction] in which they are engaged. (ii) At the first stage, depending on functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed, determine the basic return appropriate to the respective activities. Allocate the combined net profit on the basis of above. This step results in a partial allocation of the combined net profit to each enterprise. For this purpose, the allocation is undertaken with reference to margins of comparable uncontrolled entities. (iii) the balance of the combined net profit is allocated on the basis of the evaluation of the relative contribution. (iv) the total net profit from such two-tier allocation is taken to arrive at the arm’s length price. The profits so apportioned to the AE when added to the costs incurred by it in relation to international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] would result in arm’s length price. 6.38 The application of PSM can be understood with the following example: AE1 Ltd., is an Indian company.

If there are other transactions, which contribute to the profits, then the profits from transactions with AE may have to be arrived at on some approximation. (b) The rule itself provides an alternative method to arrive at the arm’s length price being the two-tier PSM; (c) If in either of the alternatives, a range of figures is available, the arithmetical mean of such figures may be adopted as the arm’s length price. It may however not be possible to adopt the arithmetical mean of the two alternatives.

Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) 6.39 Rule 10B(1)(e) transactional net margin method, by which,- (i) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise from an international transaction or the specified domestic transaction entered into with an AE is computed in relation to costs incurred"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 154 or sales effected, or assets employed or to be employed by the enterprise or having regard to any other relevant base; (ii) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise or by an unrelated enterprise from a comparable uncontrolled transaction or a number of such transactions is computed having regard to the same base; (iii) the net profit margin referred to in sub-section (ii) arising in comparable uncontrolled transactions is adjusted to take into account the differences, if any, between the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect the amount of net profit margin in the open market; (iv) the net profit margin realised by the enterprise and referred to in sub-clause (i) is established to be the same as the net profit margin referred to in sub-clause (iii); (v) the net profit margin thus established is then taken into account to arrive at an arm’s length price in relation to the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction. 6.40 Typical transactions where the transactional net margin method may be adopted are: (a) provision of services; (b) distribution of finished products where RPM cannot be applied; (c) transfer of semi-finished goods where CPM cannot be applied; (d) transactions involving intangibles where PSM cannot be applied. 6.41 The steps involved in the application of this method are: (i) Identify the net profit margin realised by the enterprise from an international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]. Where the assessee also has transactions, segments or businesses where the international transactions [or the specified domestic transaction] with   AEs are not relevant, then the net profit margin to be considered for the purposes of this TNMM method should be such net profit margin as is derived only from the transactions, segments or businesses related to the international transaction [or the specified"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 155 domestic transaction]. The net profit margin may be computed in relation to costs incurred or sales effected or assets employed or any other relevant base. For example,  • In case where the assessee acts as a distributor and the transaction pertains to import, the revenue may be used as base. • In case the transaction involves export of services/goods, costs may be taken as base provided the exporting entity acts as a contract service provider / contract manufacturer. • Return on capital employed or Return on assets are typically used in case of a capital intensive manufacturing set-ups where the tangible operating assets have a high correlation to profitability. For example: Return on capital employed or Return on assets could be used in case of a leasing company. (ii) Identify the net profit margin from a comparable uncontrolled transaction or a number of such transactions having regard to the same base; In practice, net profit margin is ascertained at segment level where segment data are available. The unallocated expenses are allocated on a reasonable basis and the segmental net profit is determined. Where segment data are not available, net profit is normally determined at enterprise level. Where internal CUT is available transaction level net profit may be determined. (iii) In case internal CUT is not available, external CUT is taken. In such case, as discussed above, net profit margin should be taken at enterprise level (segmental or enterprise as a whole) of comparable companies. A search should be carried out to identify comparable companies on the basis of information and data available with the assessee. Where such information and data are not available, search may be carried out with reference to database in public domain. (iv) The net profit margin so identified is adjusted to take into account the transaction level and enterprise level differences if any. The differences should be those that could materially affect the net profit margin in the open market;"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 156 (v) The adjusted net profit margin is taken into account to arrive at the arm’s length price in relation to the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]. 6.42 The unavailability of reliable data for comparables in case of gross profit based methods such as CPM and RPM may pose difficulties in selecting them as the most appropriate method. In such circumstances, TNMM may be considered as the most appropriate method, subject to other parameters such as degree of comparability, comparability factors, functional profile, etc. 6.43 However, this should not be construed as TNMM being a residual method or method of last resort. Though, TNMM is more tolerant to differences in the product comparability as compared to the traditional methods, the comparability standard to be applied to the TNMM requires a high degree of similarity in several factors between the tested party and the independent enterprises that may adversely affect the net margins. For example: contractual terms and conditions, functions performed, risks assumed and assets employed, pricing mechanism, availability of the comparable data, etc. 6.44 Net margins may be affected by factors that have no effect or less significant effect on gross margins or prices due to the variation of operating expenses between companies. These factors may be unrelated to transfer pricing. For example – Difference in the capacity utilisation level of the tested party vis-a-vis the comparables. 6.45 Specific factors that may affect net margins include, but are not limited to: • Barriers to entry in the industry; • Competitive position; • Management efficiency; • Individual business strategies; • Threat of substitute products; • Varying cost structures; • Difference in the working capital level; • Difference in the import vs. domestic content; • Difference in the capacity utilisation level;"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 157 • Difference in the business model: say outsourcing of some manufacturing processes vs. in-house manufacturing of all the processes; • Difference in the functions: say undertaking own market / distribution channels vs. distribution through individual distributors. 6.46 If material differences between the tested party and the independent enterprises are affecting the net margins, reasonably accurate adjustments should be made to account for such differences. 6.47 The application of the transactional net margin method may be understood with the following example: AE1 Ltd., is an Indian company  AE1 Ltd., manufactures compact disc (CD) writers and sells the same to AE2 Ltd., which is an AE of AE1 Ltd. As AE1 Ltd., does not have similar transaction with a non AE, no internal CUT is available. As AE1 Ltd., does not have information and data to identify a comparable company, it has used the databases in public domain for carrying out the search. The result of the search may be summarised as follows:  No. of companies Search on the basis of following keywords:  (a)  Computer 800 (b)  Computer hardware 250 (c)  Computer peripherals 66 Sub total 1116 Elimination process :   Companies with different activities 800 Companies with duplication when multiple database are used 75 Companies with no financials 90 Companies having significant operations like sales or purchases with related party  100 Companies reporting no operations 50 Sub total 1115 Company/companies selected – Z Ltd. 1"

"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 159 6.48 TNMM is less reliable when applied to the aggregate activities of a complex enterprise engaged in various different transactions or functions. The TNMM should thus generally not be applied on a company‐wide basis if the company is involved in a number of different transactions or functions which are not properly evaluated on an aggregate basis. However, it may be possible to apply TNMM when the aggregate activities/transactions are sufficiently interlinked, as for example when similar sales functions are conducted for products in similar product lines. 6.49 The Delhi High Court in the case of Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications India Pvt. Ltd (ITA No 16/2014) has upheld that TNMM could be effective and reliable when applied to closely-linked or continuous transactions. The following example explains that segregation of advertisement, marketing and promotion (‘AMP’) expenses as an independent transaction would lead to absurd results: Particular Case 1 Case 2 Variation Sales 1,000 1,000 1,000 Purchase price 600 500 500 Gross margin 400 500 500 AMP expense 50 150 50 Overhead expense 300 300 300 Net profit 50 50 150 TP adjustment   100 Add: Mark-up of 15%   15 Total profit   265 (115+150) 6.50 In case 2, a distributor having significant marketing functions incurred substantial expenditure on AMP, three times more than in case 1, but the purchase price being lower, the taxpayer got adequately compensated and hence, no adjustment. If the AMP in case 2 was INR 50, i.e, identical to case 1, and AMP of INR 100 was incurred as a separate transaction, this would be absurd if the TPO makes an adjustment, leading to a net profit of 26.5%, which seems absurd. Thus, it may be appropriate to aggregate the transaction of purchase and marketing efforts leading to higher AMP expenses in the instant case."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 160 6.51 However, it is important to compute profit from the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] if the activities are not interlinked and are separate. This can be achieved by using the segmental profitability based on appropriate assumptions and scientific allocation keys. However, in cases where such segmental profitability is not possible, differences in the profitability at the entity level cannot be loaded entirely on the international transactions [or the specified domestic transaction] and this would require application of the ‘principle of proportionality’.

The entire difference cannot be attributable to the sales since the sales to AEs accounts for only 40% of the total sales. Therefore, adjustment may need to be restricted to 40% of the difference. 6.53 Rule 10B(e)(iii) requires that transaction level and enterprise level differences should be adjusted if such differences materially affect the amount of net profit margin. In this example, following enterprise level differences could be visualised; (a) Working capital – There may be differences in stock holding, debtors and creditors. Appropriate adjustment to eliminate the impact of above difference may be made by taking the prevailing interest rate. For this purpose, useful reference may be made to the guidelines issued by Internal Revenue Service of USA. However, in this example, it is assumed that the difference in the working capital is not significant requiring any adjustment. (b) Cost of capital – There may be difference in the manner of funding such as equity, preference, debenture, inter corporate loans etc. In order that such difference does not impact the net profit, the operating margin on operating cost before interest is taken as profit level indicator."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 161 (c) Assets employed – There may be difference in assets employed and the method of providing depreciation. In order that such difference does not impact the net profit, the operating margin on operating cost before depreciation is taken as profit level indicator. (d) Assured or risk bearing business – There may be a difference in the customer/ revenue model of the assessee vis-à-vis the comparables. For example, the comparables identified may be entrepreneurs bearing the market risks of business volume, customer continuity, etc and the assessee’s international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] is in the nature of captive service provider or contract manufacturer with assured volumes and/or assured compensation and/or assured business period, etc. Such differences may be eliminated by making appropriate adjustment for low-risk or risk free business. (e) Difference in the capacity utilisation – There may be difference in the utilisation of capacity by the tested party and the comparables. For example: The taxpayer has utilized only 41.39% of its installed capacity (i.e. 58.61% of the fixed overheads remained unabsorbed), whereas the capacity utilized by the comparables is 80.90%.As a result, the unabsorbed fixed costs, debited to the profit and loss account due to existing accounting practices, has, in fact skewed the profit level indicator of the taxpayer for the period under consideration. As a result, it would be important to compute the profitability from manufacturing activity after removing unabsorbed fixed costs (to bring the capacity utilisation of the taxpayer in line with that of the comparables) with a view to achieve meaningful comparison. 6.54 In the above table, the transaction level differences cannot be noticed. However, some transaction level differences may exist and the same may be adjusted if requisite information is available. Some of the common transaction level differences may be as follows; (a) Free gifts (b) Extended warranty (in addition to the normal one-year)  (c) Marketing risks  (d) Pricing - Ex-Shop or FOR-destination. (e) Quantity discount"

"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 163  Further, the operating profit margins should be computed on the basis of financial statements of the assessee and the comparable company. (d) The accounting treatment of expenses and depreciation is also a critical factor in computing the arm’s length price. Unlike the preceding methods, the rule does not explicitly provide for adjustment on account of differing accounting practices. Nevertheless, such differing practices should also be factored in; (e) It is not uncommon to find purchase transaction being an international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] where TNMM is used. TNMM requires the determination of the net profit margin from an international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] and purchase transaction as such does not result in net profit. However, as purchase is inextricably linked to earning net profit, TNMM may be used for establishing arm’s length purchase value. In such case, comparable operating margin should be appropriately used to work back the arm’s length purchase cost. This may be illustrated as follows: Illustration 1: 1.

Other Method (OM) of determination of arm’s length price 6.55 The CBDT has inserted a new Rule 10AB by notifying the “Other Method” apart from the five methods already prescribed. For the purposes of clause (f) of sub-section (1) of section 92C, the Other Method for determination of the arms' length price in relation to an international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] shall be any method which takes into account the price which has been charged or paid, or would have been charged or paid, for the same or similar uncontrolled transaction, with or between non-AEs, under similar circumstances, considering all the relevant facts. 6.56 The introduction of the Other Method as the sixth method allows the use of ‘any method’ which takes into account (i) the price which has been charged or paid or (ii) would have been charged or paid for the same or similar uncontrolled transactions, with or between non-associated enterprises, under similar circumstances, considering all the relevant facts. The various data which may possibly be used for comparability purposes could be:  (a) Third party quotations/ invoices; (b) Valuation reports; (c) Tender/Bid documents; (d) Documents relating to the negotiations; (e) Standard rate cards; (f) Commercial & economic business models; etc. 6.57 It is relevant to note that the text of Rule 10AB does not describe any methodology but only provides an enabling provision to use any method that has been used or may be used to arrive at price of a transaction undertaken between non AEs. Hence, it provides flexibility to determine the price in complex transactions where third party comparable prices or transactions"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 167 may not exist. The wide coverage of the Other Method would provide flexibility in establishing arm’s length prices, particularly in cases where the application of the five specific methods is not possible due to reasons such as difficulties in obtaining comparable data due to uniqueness of transactions such as intangibles or business transfers, transfer of unlisted shares, sale of fixed assets, revenue allocation/splitting, guarantees provided and received, etc. However, it would be necessary to justify and document reasons for rejection of all other five methods while selecting the ‘Other Method’ as the most appropriate method. The OECD Guidelines also permit the use of any other method and state that the taxpayer retain the freedom to apply methods not described in OECD Guidelines to establish prices, provided those prices satisfy the arm’s length principle. 6.58 The application of the sixth method may be understood with the following examples: Illustration A  AE1 Ltd. is an Indian Company. AE1 Ltd. owns certain registered patents which it has developed by undertaking research and development. It is a subsidiary of AE2 Ltd., a foreign company. AE1 Ltd. has sold its registered patents to AE2 Ltd., for `50 crores. The price has been determined based on a valuation report obtained from an independent valuer. The sale of patents is a unique transaction and AE1 Ltd or AE2 Ltd. has not entered into similar transactions with third parties and hence no internal or external CUP is available. AE1 Ltd. may select the Other Method as the most appropriate method and use the independent valuation report for comparability purposes. Illustration B An Indian Company (I Co) buys back its equity shares issued to its foreign   AE (AE Co). I Co obtains a valuation report from an external firm identifying the fair market value of these shares. I Co purchases the shares at the value determined in the valuation report. This value denotes a price that would have been charged if a third party would have bought the same shares. Hence, I Co could use Rule 10AB and rely upon the valuation report to demonstrate this transaction to be arm’s length."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 168 Illustration C An Indian Company (I Co) incurs hotel and travel expenses for the employees of its foreign AE (AE Co) visiting India for a global seminar, These expenses are paid by I Co directly to third party vendors on behalf of AE Co and recovered on a cost-to-cost basis from AE Co. Further, such activity does not entail a service element for I Co and hence does not necessitate a mark-up. Hence, I Co may select the Other Method and rely upon such back-to-back arrangement to demonstrate this recovery transaction to be arm’s length. Illustration D An Indian Company (I Co) deputes some of its employees to its foreign AE (AE Co) through secondment. AE Co takes these individuals onboard by issuing letter of employments and is responsible for payment of the salary of the employees. I Co frequently facilitates payment of salaries to the overseas accounts of the seconded employees purely for administrative convenience. In this case, salary costs are reimbursed by AE Co to I Co on a cost-to-cost basis. Hence, I Co may select the Other Method and rely upon such back-to-back arrangement to demonstrate transaction to be arm’s length. Illustration E Another example where this method could be used is in cases of cost allocation arrangements where a taxpayer benefits from certain services provided by a central entity of the group and has to pay a portion of the total cost incurred by the service provider. These costs are generally allocated on the basis of allocation keys like headcount, time spent, revenues etc. and a third party outside the group may not have the capability to provide identical services. Hence, in the absence of comparable prices or transactions, Rule 10AB may be applied and the cost allocation arrangement could be justified appropriately. Most appropriate method  6.59 (1) For the purposes of sub-section (1) of section 92C, the most appropriate method shall be the method which is best suited to the facts and circumstances of each particular international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction], and which provides the most reliable measure of an arm’s length price in relation to the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]."
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 169 (2) In selecting the most appropriate method as specified in sub-rule (1), the following factors shall be taken into account, namely:- (a) the nature and class of the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction]; (b) the class or classes of AEs entering into the transaction and the functions performed by them taking into account assets employed or to be employed and risks assumed by such enterprises; (c) the availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for application of the method; (d) the degree of comparability existing between the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] and the uncontrolled transaction and between the enterprises entering into such transactions; (e) the extent to which reliable and accurate adjustments can be made to account for differences, if any, between the international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] and the comparable uncontrolled transaction or between the enterprises entering into such transactions; (f) the nature, extent and reliability of assumptions required to be made in application of a method. [Rule 10C]. 6.60 No particular method is suitable in every possible situation. It is not possible to provide specific rules that will cover every case. While selecting the most appropriate method, the factors prescribed in section 92C of the Act and Rule 10C(2) should be considered. Amongst these factors, the functions performed by AEs (including assets employed and risks assumed) should be given due consideration. It is also important to ascertain the extent and reliability of the uncontrolled data that is available. The nature of the available data, and especially the amount and reliability of detail on the factors entering into a comparability analysis, are very important issues in the selection and application of a methodology. Although it is difficult to prescribe general principles for choice of most appropriate method, the following broad categorisation may be considered as already indicated under each of the respective methods:"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 170 (i) CUP method may be used in case of loans, service fee, transfer of tangibles, sale and purchase of goods/ commodities, etc; (ii) RPM is most useful in case of marketing operations of finished products, especially in case of distributors not performing significant value addition to the product; (iii) CPM is normally used where raw materials or semi-finished goods are sold; where joint facility agreements or long-term buy-and-supply arrangements, or the provision of services are involved; (iv) PSM is normally used in cases where the transactions involve provision of integrated services by more than one enterprise. For example – One enterprise holds technology and the other enterprise holds the distribution network and both are the key intangibles for the overall success of the Group; freight forwarders and supply chain specialists. (v) Transactional net margin method could be used in case of manufacturing operations, sale of raw materials or semi-finished goods where CPM is not the most appropriate method, and marketing operations of finished products where RPM is not the most appropriate method. (vi) Other method may be used in case of royalties, commodities, transfer of intangibles and shares, etc. 6.61 For the purposes of sub-rule (1) of Rule 10B, the comparability of an international transaction [or the specified domestic transaction] with an uncontrolled transaction shall be judged with reference to the following namely:- (a) the specific characteristics of the property transferred or services provided in either transaction; (b) the functions performed, taking into account assets employed or to be employed and the risks assumed, by the respective parties to the transactions; (c) the contractual terms (whether or not such terms are formal or in writing) of the transactions which lay down explicitly or implicitly how the responsibilities, risks and benefits are to be divided between the respective parties to the transactions;"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 171 (d) conditions prevailing in the markets in which the respective parties to the transaction operate, including the geographical location and size of the markets, the laws and government orders in force, costs of labour and capital in the markets, overall economic development and level of competition and whether the markets are wholesale or retail. 6.62 While evaluating each method the distinctive aspects of computation should be borne in mind. For instance, RPM requires functional and other differences including accounting practices to be adjusted to the price whereas CPM and TNMM require such differences to be adjusted to the margin. 6.63 Different methods may be chosen as most appropriate method for different transactions of the assessee as long as the rationale for each of such choices are adequately documented. Also, different methods may be chosen for the same transaction in different years as long as the rationale for each such choice made in each year is adequately documented. Multiple Year Data and Range Concept 6.64  Appreciating that Transfer Pricing is not science but is influenced by several factors the authorities decided to move away from single year concept. At the same time, it was appreciated that with the data bases becoming robust time has come to adopt range concept for the determination of the arm’s length price. Consequently, as mentioned in para 1.26 of this book, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on October 20, 2015 issued the final rules ie, Rule 10B(5) and Rule 10CA to give effect to the use of ‘multiple year data’ and ‘range concept’. These rules are applicable to international transactions and specified domestic transactions that are entered into by taxpayers on or after 1 April 2014. Rule 10CA (which forms part of Annexure II of this book) contains illustrations of application of the arm’s length range concept. This is exhaustive and must be analysed to appreciate the approach recommended. Vide Notification No. 124/2021[F. No. 500/1/2014-APA-II] dated 29th October, 2021 it was notified that where the variation between the arm’s length price determined under section 92C and the price at which the international transaction or specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken does not exceed one per cent. of the latter in respect of wholesale trading and three per cent of the latter in all other cases, the price at which the international transaction or specified domestic transaction has"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 172 actually been undertaken shall be deemed to be the arm’s length price for Assessment Year 2021-2022. In essence, this extended the approach applied for the earlier years. It was, further clarified that for the purposes of the notification, “wholesale trading” means an international transaction or specified domestic transaction of trading in goods, which fulfils the following conditions, namely:-  (a) purchase cost of finished goods is eighty per cent. or more of the total cost pertaining to such trading activities; and  (b) average monthly closing inventory of such goods is ten per cent. or less of sales pertaining to such trading activities. 6.65 Transfer Pricing Adjustments (Economic Adjustments) In terms of Rule 10B(3) appropriate comparability adjustments are required to be made while computing the arm’s length Rule 10B(3) of the rules provides that: “An uncontrolled transaction shall be comparable to an international transaction if— (i) none of the differences, if any, between the transactions being compared, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions are likely to materially affect the price or cost charged or paid in, or the profit arising from, such transactions in the open market; or (ii) reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the material effects of such differences.” Arguably, the most common adjustments are working capital adjustment and capacity utilization adjustment. These are discussed hereunder, in brief. Further Statutory provisions suggest various adjustments under various methods Methods Adjustments suggested  CUP Method  [Rule 10B(1)(a)(ii)]  Price of uncontrolled transaction is adjusted to account for differences, if any, between the international transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect the price in the open market.

"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 173 Methods Adjustments suggested  international transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect the amount of gross profit margin in the open market. CPM [Rule 10B(1)(c)(iii)]   The normal gross profit mark-up is adjusted to take into account the functional and other differences, if any, between the international transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect such profit mark-up in the open market. TNM method [Rule 10B(1)(e)(iii)]  The net profit margin arising in comparable uncontrolled transactions have to be adjusted to take into account the differences, if any, between the international transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which could materially affect the amount of net profit margin in the open market. Thus, rule 10B prescribes two types of adjustments: • Enterprise level differences • Transactional differences These adjustments have to be based on the specific characteristics of the property transferred or services provided in relation to transaction and the contractual terms (whether or not such terms are formal or in writing) of the transactions which lay down explicitly or implicitly how the responsibilities, risks and benefits are to be divided between the respective parties to the transactions. Rule 10B suggests the following Enterprise level and Transaction level adjustments: • Functional differences • Assets differences • Risks differences • Geographical location • Size of the markets • Wholesale or retail market"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 174 • The laws and Government orders in force • Costs of labour • Cost of capital in the markets • Overall economic development • Level of competition • Accounting practices These factors should be considered while searching for comparable. However, it is not always possible to get the accurate comparables. Hence, one has to choose the nearest possible comparable and adjust the differences which materially affect the price of comparable. There is no specific guidance, on numbers and amount of adjustments, either in Indian Laws or in OECD and UN Guidelines. The OECD TPG 2022 [para 3.47 to 3.54] provides the following guidance: • Comparability adjustments should be considered if (and only if) they are expected to increase the reliability of the results and are expected to improve comparability. • Relevant considerations in this regard include the materiality of the difference for which an adjustment is being considered, the quality of the data subject to adjustment, the purpose of the adjustment and the reliability of the approach used to make the adjustment. • It bears emphasis that comparability adjustments are only appropriate for differences that will have a material effect on the comparison. • It should be noted that the need to perform numerous or substantial adjustments to key comparability factors may indicate that the third-party transactions are in fact not sufficiently comparable. Therefore, it is provided that where there are numerous or substantial adjustments to key comparability factors, it may indicate that the third-party transactions are in fact not sufficiently comparable. However, differences in the use of assets can sometimes be eliminated or reduced to a significant extent by making comparability adjustments on account of working capital or capacity utilization1. 1 UNTPM 2021"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 175 6.65. Working Capital Adjustments: In a competitive environment2, money has a time value. If a company provided, say, 60 days trade terms for payment of accounts, the price of the goods should equate to the price for immediate payment plus 60 days of interest on the immediate payment price. By carrying high accounts receivable a company is allowing its customers a relatively long period to pay their accounts. It would need to borrow money to fund the credit terms and/or suffer a reduction in the amount of cash surplus which it would otherwise have available to invest. In a competitive environment, the price should therefore include an element to reflect these payment terms and compensate for the timing effect. Working capital3 is a financial metric which represents operating liquidity available to a business. Along with fixed assets such as plant and equipment, working capital is considered a part of operating capital. Net working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. If current assets are less than current liabilities, an entity has a working capital deficiency, also called a working capital deficit. Current assets and current liabilities include three accounts which are of special importance. They are: accounts receivable (current asset)/inventory (current assets), and/accounts payable (current liability). These accounts represent the areas of the business where managers have the most direct impact. Working capital adjustments are typically performed when applying the TNMM, Cost-plus and Resale price methods. They account for the fact that there is an opportunity cost and notional finance cost associated with the holding of working capital. Working Capital = [accounts receivable + inventory] - accounts payable By performing working capital adjustments, operating profit that measures profit before accounting for explicit interest expenses or income can be corrected for the implicit interest embedded in sales and cost of goods sold to increase the comparability of the transactions. 2 OECD TPG 2022 - Annex to Chapter III- Example of a Working Capital Adjustment 3 Demag Cranes & Components (India) (P.)

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 176 OECD Guidance on WCA If there are material differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions, adjustments should be made if the effect of such differences on prices or profits can be ascertained with sufficient accuracy to improve the reliability of the results. The OECD re-iterates that working capital adjustments should only be considered when the reliability of the comparables will be improved, and reasonably accurate adjustments can be made. (See OECD 2017 Annex to Chapter III para 1) For instance, in the OECD’s 2017 Transfer Pricing Guidelines (TPG), its states at 2.87 that ""in those cases where there is a correlation between credit terms and sales prices, it could be appropriate to reflect interest income in respect of short-term working capital within the calculation of the net profit indicator and/or to proceed with a working capital adjustment."" Similarly, in the case of the comparable uncontrolled price method, differences in contractual terms e.g., sales or purchase volumes and credit terms, may require working capital adjustments to the comparable prices. Relevant market evidence of third-party behaviour that supports adjusting prices or returns for the differences in working capital seems vital, as does an analysis of the payment terms and practices used by the tested party and comparables. The reliability of a WCA should be considered in other ways as well. For instance, a WCA involves adding or removing a notional cost of funds (which could be represented as the cost of debt or equity) to/from a comparables prices or financial results, but that notional cost could in fact be constrained by commercial factors impacting the level and cost of debt that a company is able to carry. In some cases, a comparable or tested party however may not be able to access the level of funds that a WCA may imply. Further, the arm’s length level and cost of debt, or equity of a firm would need to use that source of funds, will need to be calculated as well, possibly impacting interest expenses claimed if the tested party is being adjusted (say, to an arm’s length level of working capital). There may also be questions about whether the tested party or the comparables are the entities whose prices or margins need to be adjusted. For instance, it may be a concern that the tested party has adopted working capital policies that aren’t arm’s length, due to the control of the parent over the tested party in more ways than just pricing. Before adjusting the comparables to meet the level of working capital reported by the tested party, additional review would be necessary to understand the reasons for the"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 177 tested party’s working capital. It may be appropriate, where non-arm's length payable terms have been adopted, to adjust the tested party for that feature and then consider anew the need for a WCA. A review of comparables from the tested party’s industry and dealing in similar products might provide insight both into arm’s length capital structures as well as insights into pricing behaviour and the nature of competition in the tested party’s industry. There are other issues that might impact on the reliability of working capital adjustments including: • Differences in seasonal vs non-seasonal capital needs of the tested party and comparables, based on different economic circumstances, markets, product or service offerings that impact prices reported; • Differences in reported working capital balances due to different reporting dates, which can be relevant when tested party and comparables reporting periods don’t align; and • Merger and acquisition or other events that suddenly shift tested party’s or comparables’ working capital levels. As noted above, an appropriate interest rate (preferably operational interest rate of the tested party jurisdiction) to apply to a difference in working capital must be chosen. Working capital - type adjustments are also sometimes proposed to make an adjustment for differences in functions, assets, and risks, in relation to inventories; or in business strategies, particularly those relating to the provision of finance to customers. The following hypothetical illustration [UN TPM, 2021] is provided merely to demonstrate how a working capital adjustment can be calculated. It should not be construed as the only way in which such an adjustment may be calculated.

Capacity utilization adjustment In the starting phase of any business, it is not easy to get business but minimum infrastructure having regard to nature of business have to be created. Some of the facilities are of fixed nature and some are of variable nature. Building for office, factory and machineries have to be taken even the production may not be possible at 100% of the capacity. Rent of the building is generally of fixed nature even the production start at just 20% of the capacity. Thus, 80% rent is relating to excess capacity. If the comparable is operating at 80% or 100% capacity, then it would not be a proper comparable unless some adjustments have been made. In accounting terminology, fixed costs will broadly include almost all costs (expenses) which are not included in cost of goods sold, and variable costs are those captured in costs of goods. The implicit assumption required to make the equivalence between the accounting and economics terminology is that the accounting period is equal to the period in which fixed costs do not vary in relation to production. In practice, this equivalence does not always"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 179 hold, and depending on the period under consideration by management, some overhead expenses (eg, sales, general and administrative expenses) can be adjusted by management, and the specific allocation of each expense to each category will be decided under cost accounting. The issue of capacity utilisation can arise in the following situations:  • Start-up phase • Expansion phase • Economic recession phase • Under-utilisation or over utilisation of resources Entities differ in size as well as in levels of activities so do the available comparables for the purpose of transfer pricing determination. Extent of capacity utilization is an accepted adjustment to improve comparability to overcome the differences mentioned above. This adjustment finds support in the OECD TP Guidelines and the United Nations TP Manual (including the India chapter). By definition, capacity utilization is the extent to which an enterprise actually uses its installed productive capacity. It is the relationship between actual output using the installed infrastructure, and the potential output which could arise, if capacity was fully used. Typically expressed as a percentage, this factor becomes an important comparability factor as it helps measure productive efficiency and cost effectiveness, i.e., extent of output vis-à-vis investment in or costs associated with the underlying infrastructure (the costs are generally referred to as “fixed costs” in cost accounting terms). By virtue of its definition, the concept of capacity utilization assumes most relevance in the case of manufacturing concerns. It is Important to address two critical questions in relation to this adjustment, viz., (i) whether the adjustment should be made to the tested party or to comparables? (ii) how to compute the adjustment? Further, particularly in light of the fact that there is no mechanism specified under the Act or the Rules for computing the amount of capacity utilization adjustment. Even the OECD TP Guidelines and the United Nations TP Manual do not address the second question."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 180 The rationale to eliminate capacity under-utilization when applying the TNMM is that the TNMM may be more acceptable than the other prescribed methods under the Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’) as the differences in the levels of absorption of indirect fixed costs would affect the net profit margin and not the gross margin / gross mark-up on cost. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2022, prescribe the making of adjustments to eliminate differences in capacity utilization or idle capacity adjustments. Also, Rule 10B(1)(e)(iii) of the Income-tax Rules, 1962 (‘the Rules’) stipulates that an adjustment to the net profit margin can be made for “capacity underutilization”. Capacity under-utilization by enterprises is a factor affecting net profit margin because lower capacity utilization results in higher per unit costs, which, in turn, results in lower profits at a transactional or unit level. There is no debate on the need for adjustments, however the issue is as to the reasonable accuracy in the mechanism for such adjustments, so long as a reasonable adjustment mechanism can be employed, objections to the adjustment won’t hold. In this context, it is useful to recall the observations of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Sony Ericsson Mobile Communication India Pvt. Ltd. [March 2015]: “It must be stated that transfer pricing is not an exact science but a method of legitimate quantification which requires exercise of judgment on the part of the administration and the taxpayer. It is method and formula based and therefore is rational and scientific”. At present there is no authoritative guidance relating to capacity utilization adjustments but the decision of the Delhi Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal’s (‘the Tribunal’) in the case of Claas India Private Limited [ITA No. 1783/Del/2011], has put forth useful observations and guidelines on capacity utilization adjustment. Since neither the Act nor the Rules provide the mechanism for computing capacity utilization adjustment, but in this judgment the Tribunal has laid down the following important principles: • It is essential to ascertain the percentage of capacity utilization by the taxpayer and the comparables when applying the TNMM. • The difference in the percentage of capacity utilization of the taxpayer vis-à-vis comparables should be given effect to in the operating profit of comparables by adjusting their respective operating costs. The Tribunal explained that operating costs can be either fixed, variable or semi-variable:"
"Methods of Computation of Arm’s Length Price 181 • Semi-variable costs need to be split into fixed and variable part. • The variable costs and the variable portion of the semi-variable costs remain unaffected due to any under or overutilization of capacity. • The fixed operating costs and the fixed part of the semi-variable costs are scaled up or down by considering the percentage of capacity utilization by the taxpayer and such comparable. In regard to capacity utilization re-emphasizes the need for maintaining credible and accurate information for transfer pricing purposes. The decision is indeed welcome and perhaps seminal, addressing the concerns of industry and professionals alike and providing much needed guidance to the Revenue and taxpayers when making capacity utilization adjustments. However, in case there are some differences between the comparables and the assessee, then the effect of such differences should be ironed out by making suitable adjustment to the operating profit margin of comparables. That is the way for bringing both the transactions, namely, the international transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, on the same platform for making a meaningful and effective comparison. The above analysis overtly transpires that the law provides for adjusting the profit margin of comparables on account of the material differences between the international transaction of the assessee and comparable uncontrolled transactions. It is not the other way around to adjust the profit margin of the assessee. In other words, the net operating profit margin realized by the assessee from its international transaction is to be computed as such, without adjusting it on account of differences with the comparable uncontrolled transactions. The adjustment, if any, is required to be made only in the profit margins of the comparables. Importance and impact of capacity utilisation adjustment is also explained by way of an example in Dy. CIT v Petro Araldite (P.) Ltd. [2013] 35 taxmann.com 590 (Mumbai - Trib.)4. 4 Dy. CIT v Petro Araldite (P.) Ltd.

This happens mainly because of higher allocation or absorption of fixed overheads at lower capacity utilization which comes down as the level of capacity utilization goes up. For instance, as given in the above example, the rate of allocation or absorption of fixed overheads to sales is 40% at 50% capacity utilization while it becomes 33.33% at 60% capacity utilization and 25% at 80% capacity utilization giving more profit margin of 16.67% at 60% capacity utilization and 25% at 80% capacity utilization as against profit margin of 10% at 50% capacity utilization. The difference in capacity utilization thus materially affects the profit margin and if there is a difference in the level of capacity utilization of the assessee and the level of capacity utilization of the comparable companies, adjustment is required to be made to the profit margin of the comparables on account of difference in capacity utilization as per clause (e)(iii) of sub-rule (1) of Rule 10-B of the Income Tax Rules, 1962. The adjustment thus can be made to the profit margin of the comparables by allocating fixed overheads at the same rate at which fixed overheads are allocated in the case of the tested party. For example, in the case of a comparable having 80% capacity utilization, the rate of allocation of fixed expenses is 25% of the sales as against the rate of allocation of fixed overheads of 40% in the case of the tested party working at 50% capacity. Hence, adjustment needs to be made to make it comparable. Therefore, margin of comparable need to be computed by taking absorption rate of 40% instead of 25% rate of actual absorption."
"Chapter 7 Documentation and Verification Type of information and documents 7.1 Rule 10D(1) lays down thirteen different types of information and documents that a person has to keep and maintain in relation to the international transactions undertaken in a given financial year. Broadly, these information and documents may be classified into three types: (i) enterprise-wise documents – These are documents that describe the enterprise, the relationships with other associated enterprise, the nature of business carried out, etc. This information is, largely, descriptive [clauses (a) to (c)]. (ii) transaction-specific documents – These are documents that explain the international transaction in greater detail. It includes information with regard to each transaction (nature and terms of the contract, etc. ), description of the functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed by each party to the transaction, economic and market analyses, etc. This information is both descriptive and quantitative in nature [clauses (d) to (h)]. (iii) Computation related documents – These are documents which describe and detail the methods considered, actual working assumptions, policies etc., adjustments made to transfer prices and any other relevant information, data, document relied for determination of arm’s length price [clause (i) to (m)]. 7.2 The documentation requirements prescribed in  section 92D read with Rule 10D applies not only to international transactions between associated enterprises but also to the deemed international transactions covered under Section 92B(2) of the Act as well as the specified domestic transactions covered under Section 92BA of the Act. 7.3 It is pertinent to note that the list of documents provided under Rule 10D are prescriptive in nature and it is not essential that each of the document be maintained in respect of each international transaction.

If this term were to be given the meaning provided in section 92F(iii), then it would virtually include every member in the register of members. No purpose would then be served by duplicating the contents of that register. Where the person is a company, the names of members who are associated enterprises, the number of shares held by each of them and the percentage of their holding to the total holding has to be stated. 7.6 However, where the number of members is very large, a generic classification of the ownership structure may be given, namely, holdings by Government (Central, State), Government companies, public financial institutions, nationalised and other banks, mutual funds, venture capitalists, foreign holdings, bodies corporate, directors and relatives, others. The holdings of associated enterprises must, in any case, be shown separately. 7.7 Where the person is a firm or an association of persons, the names of the partners of the firm or members of the association of persons and their profit sharing ratios have to be stated. Similar details, to the extent applicable, need to be furnished when the person is a body of individuals, trust, Hindu undivided family, etc. The description of the ownership structure should be stated as at the day on which one person became an associated enterprise of another and as at every other day on which there was change in the ownership interest of that other enterprise. 7.8 For example, assume that A Ltd., India and X Inc., USA, are associated enterprises, and the holdings of X Inc. in A Ltd. were as under: (a) Total number of 10, fully paid equity shares, issued by and subscribed in A Ltd. 100,000 (b) Total number of shares of 10, fully paid up, held by X Inc. on 1st April, 2001 50,000"

However, where other methods are used, say Cost Plus Method, Resale Price Method, some relaxation in the comparability parameters (evaluated for the purpose of the analysis) could be adopted whereby overall basket of products (say caustic soda in the above example) could be considered as comparable. The yardstick could be further relaxed in case Transactional Net Margin Method is used whereby companies dealing in similar products and having similar functional profiles could be considered as comparable. To illustrate, in the above example, in case Transactional Net Margin Method is used as the most appropriate method, manufacturers of chemicals (having similar functional profile as the tested party) could be considered as comparables. (ii) The enterprise must also confirm that the listing of uncontrolled transactions is complete and that no similar or identical transactions have been omitted. 7.47 For example, if the enterprise is dealing in electronic components (integrated circuits and printed circuit boards) and its transactions with associated enterprises have been conducted throughout the year, the enterprise must establish that the database from which the list has been compiled at least covers the period during which transactions with the associated enterprise took place. The enterprise should maintain / provide detailed reasons as to why particular set of data points can be or cannot be considered as comparable to the international transaction / specified domestic transaction under consideration. 7.48 In order to conduct an analysis the enterprise is required to collect data regarding comparable uncontrolled transaction or comparable companies engaged in similar business. The enterprise has to prepare a search memo detailing the process of identification of comparable uncontrolled transaction and/or comparable companies. The enterprise has to provide information regarding the databases used for the search and economic rationale for the selection/rejection of transaction/companies. The summary of the selection/rejection process has to be documented through a search matrix. Further, the enterprise should demonstrate that the analysis undertaken to determine the comparables is scientific and does not represent a cherry picking. In summary, the enterprise must prove that the rationale"
"Documentation and Verification 197 used by it in the process of searching for and including/excluding uncontrolled transactions is correct, logical and complete. For the said purpose, the Assessee may place reliance on the global transfer pricing guidelines1. 7.49 The Accountant shall examine details of the comparable transactions/data compiled by the enterprise. Further, exercising his professional judgement, the Accountant should verify that the data used to determine / analyse the arm’s nature of the price of the international transaction/ specified domestic transaction is in tune with the findings of the functional analysis. This would ensure the authenticity of the price so arrived on the basis of the data. 7.50 A record of the analysis performed to evaluate comparability of uncontrolled transactions with the relevant international transaction [or specified domestic transaction, as the case may be] [clause (h), Rule 10D (1)]. 7.51 The process to be described under this clause (record of analysis of data) is the naturally corollary to the process described in immediately preceding clause, clause (g) (record of compilation of data). 7.52 In trying to arrive at the comparability between uncontrolled transactions and international transactions / specified domestic transactions, the enterprise has to, amongst other things, carryout the process of resolving any differences that may exist between them. These differences could be for the reasons stated in Rule 10B (2) or for any other reason also. Under this clause, the enterprise has to detail the analysis that he has conducted on each of the uncontrolled transactions in determining whether or not it is comparable to an international transaction / specified domestic transaction. 7.53 The Accountant needs to report the details of the method adopted by the Assessee to benchmark the transaction. In this regard, Accountant is not obligated to ascertain whether the method adopted by the Assessee is the most appropriate method (the selection of the most appropriate method is the responsibility of the Assessee; Accountant is not required to assess / comment on the appropriateness of the same). Rather, the Accountant should check the facts and the method stated has indeed been applied by the Assessee to the benchmark the transaction. 12. OCED guidelines / UN TP Manual"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 198 Description of methods considered and working thereof 7.54 A description of the methods considered for determining the arm's length price in relation to each international transaction [or specified domestic transaction, as the case may be] or class of transaction, the method selected as the most appropriate method along with explanations as to why such method was so selected, and how such method was applied in each case [clause (i), Rule 10D(1)]. 7.55 When ascertaining the “most appropriate method”, the provisions of section 92C(1) and Rule 10C must be kept in mind. Given that the law envisages selection of the “most appropriate method” for ascertaining the arm’s length nature of the international transaction or specified domestic transaction, it is required that each of the six prescribed methods are duly analysed before selecting one as the most appropriate. 7.56 Under this clause, the Assessee has to describe the nature of the international transaction / specified domestic transaction, explain why the method chosen is the most appropriate method (may be, even, explaining why other methods were excluded) and then detail the manner in which the method was applied to the transaction under examination. In detailing the manner in which the method was applied, a numerical exercise is not expected. This is because the detailing of the arithmetic process is included under clause (j), infra. 7.57 The OECD, in their Transfer Pricing Guidelines has set out the optimal conditions under which a particular method is more suited than another. For example, the cost plus method is “probably is most useful where semi-finished goods are sold between associated parties, where associated parties have concluded joint facility agreements or long-term buy-and-supply arrangements, or where the controlled transaction is the provision of services.” By using these guidelines and analysing the intrinsic nature of the international transaction /specified domestic transaction, it may be possible to determine which is the most appropriate method to be applied to each transaction. 7.58 This exercise has to be carried out once for every type of international transaction / specified domestic transaction; and"
"Documentation and Verification 199 7.59 As stated in para 7.53 above, the primary responsibility for selection of the most appropriate method is the responsibility of the Assessee. The Accountant is not required to assess or comment on the appropriateness of the same. It needs to report the details of the method adopted by the Assessee to benchmark the transaction. 7.60 A record of the actual working carried out for determining the arm's length price, including details of the comparable data and financial information used in applying the most appropriate method, and adjustments, if any, which were made to account for differences between the international transaction [or specified domestic transaction, as the case may be]and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions [clause (j), Rule 10D (1)]. 7.61 Once the enterprise has compiled the raw data [clause (g)], analysed the data for comparability [clause (h)] and chosen the most appropriate method [clause (i)], the next step would be to perform the actual exercise of arriving at the arm’s length price. This is the process that is contemplated under this clause. 7.62 Here, the enterprise will have to detail all the mathematical iterations and steps that have been undertaken to arrive at the arm’s length price. Where any assumptions have been made, or where any critical factors have affected the determination of the arm’s length price, the numerical effect of these factors have not only to be stated but computed. The actual listing of these assumption, factors, etc. is required to be done under the provisions of clause (k), infra. Also, detailed working in respect of the adjustments undertaken by the enterprise needs to be detailed. 7.63 In assigning numbers to qualitative factors such as policies, price negotiations, etc. there may be an element of subjectivity. The enterprise may have to conclusively establish that no element of bias has entered the computational process. 7.64 The documentation on economic analysis shall also provide for the details of the data used and data rejected with reasons thereof. Also, different companies follow different accounting policies and there may be differences in respect of terms of sale etc., these variations call for certain adjustments in the financial to make the data comparable. The reasons and the adjustments so made should also be recorded."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 200 7.65 The Accountant should examine the correctness of such working and the adjustments made with reference to the relevant information and data. 7.66 The assumptions, policies and price negotiations, if any, which have critically affected the determination of the arm's length price [clause (k), Rule 10D (1)]. 7.67 This part requires the enterprise to render a narrative description of the various assumptions, policies, price negotiations that have been considered in determining the arm’s length price. 7.68 An example of an assumption affecting the determination of the arm’s length price could be the buyer’s commitment to purchase certain specified quantities of the product. 7.69 Examples of a policy affecting the determination of the arm’s length price could be  • the enterprise’s decision to make his borrowings in overseas markets (where the rates are lower than as compared with indigenous banks) and reduce the interest component in his product cost sheet • market penetration strategy, wherein the products/ services of the enterprise could be priced lower than the market in order to create a market for itself. This could also lead to the enterprise making operating losses in the start-up phase i.e. first few years of its operations. • credit policy of the enterprise, which would lead to different working capital cycles between enterprises operating in the same industry, thereby also affecting prices and sales realization • sales being made by the enterprise to its associated enterprise in order to make optimal use of its production capacity (which has no alternate use) whereby the concept of marginal costing rather full costing is used to derive the transfer price  7.70 An example of a price negotiation affecting the determination of the arm’s length price could be the manner in which the supplies are paid for. For example, a supply to an associated enterprise in China may get a better price if the payment is received in US Dollars instead of Chinese Yuan. Another example could be where an associated enterprise in Nigeria may get a better price if the letter of credit is accepted by a UK Bank rather than a local bank."
"Documentation and Verification 201 7.71 The Accountant shall obtain information about the assumptions, policies and price negotiations, if any, including understanding of the business/commercial reasons which influenced the determination of the arm’s length price by way of representation from the management of the Assessee. The Accountant shall examine the functional analysis and the results of the economic analysis to determine the assumptions, policies and price negotiations that have been considered for determining the arm’s length price and shall verify if the enterprise has maintained a document explicitly stating these assumptions, policies and price negotiations. 7.72 Details of the adjustments, if any, made to transfer prices to align them with arm's length prices determined under these rules and consequent adjustment made to the total income for tax purposes [clause (l), Rule 10D(1)]. 7.73 This process requires the enterprise to prepare a reconciliation statement detailing how the actual transaction value can be compared with the arm’s length price. This is a critical process in order to ensure a like to like comparison (to the extent possible). This is a two-stage process, detailed below. 7.74 Where the international transaction has certain characteristics that are absent in the uncontrolled transaction, the value of these characteristics has to be computed and reduced from the value of the international transaction. 7.75 Correspondingly, where the international transaction/ specified domestic transaction does not have certain characteristics that are present in the uncontrolled transaction, the value of these characteristics has to be computed and included in the value of the international transaction / specified domestic transaction. Some common adjustments that are carried out to achieve the above are: • Working capital adjustment  • Risk adjustment • Idle capacity adjustment/ Start-up cost adjustment • Depreciation adjustment The enterprise would need to maintain detailed workings demonstrating the computation of the adjustments, the basis used to arrive at the same as well the source of data used to obtain financial information for the computation of such adjustment."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 202 7.76 In case there is a difference between the transaction price and the arm’s length price, the transaction price is required to be aligned to the arm’s length price. 7.77 The Accountant shall review the adjustments (whenever required) made to transfer price / benchmarking analysis of the company so as to align it with the arm’s length prices / transfer price, as determined under these rules and verify that consequent adjustment is made to the total income for tax purposes. 7.78 Any other information, data or document, including information or data relating to the associated enterprise, which may be relevant for determination of the arm's length price [clause (m), Rule 10D (1)]. 7.79 This is a residuary clause that allows the enterprise to use any other extraneous reasons that may have affected its judgement in the process of complying with the arm’s length principle. 7.80 An example of such a situation could be when a loss-making enterprise sells goods to an associated enterprise at less than the “arm’s length price” only because this is the only way in which the enterprise may be able to absorb fixed costs/ overheads. 7.81 Where any other information, data or document has been considered relevant for the determination of arm’s length price by the Assessee, the Accountant shall by placing reliance on the written representation from the management of the Assessee review the correctness of the same. Relief from maintenance of specific records 7.82 Nothing contained in sub-rule (1) in so far as it relates to an international transaction shall apply in a case where the aggregate value, as recorded in the books of account, of international transactions entered into by the Assessee does not exceed one crore rupees: Provided that the Assessee shall be required to substantiate on the basis of material available with him, that income or expenses as the case may be arising from international transactions entered into by him has been computed in accordance with section 92. [Rule 10D(2)] 7.83 The ceiling limit of INR 1 crore is with reference to an Assessee and not with reference to any undertaking or unit. The limit applies with reference to all the international transactions entered into during a previous year. The amount is reckoned on the basis of the aggregate value of international"

In case of Assessees who fall within this category in a particular previous year,  relief given is from maintaining the specific records and detail documents prescribed in rule 10D. There is no exemption for such Assessees in obtaining and furnishing audit report under section 92E of the Act. 7.84 It requires to be mentioned that even in such cases, the onus lies on the Assessee to substantiate that income or expense as the case may be arising from international transaction has been computed on the basis of arm’s length price. It is, therefore, necessary for those Assessees to maintain such materials or records as may enable them to discharge the burden of proof cast on them. The Accountant, in such cases, is required to examine the records so maintained and satisfy himself that the material in the possession of the Assessee is relevant and proper for the purpose of expressing his opinion in the report to be issued in Form No.3CEB. Supporting documents 7.85 The information specified in sub-rule (1) and 2A shall be supported by authentic documents, which may include the following: (a) official publications, reports, studies and data bases from the Government of the country of residence of the associated enterprise or of any other country; (b) reports of market research studies carried out and technical publications brought out by institutions of national or international repute; (c) price publications including stock exchange and commodity market quotations; (d) published accounts and financial statements relating to the business affairs of the associated enterprises; (e) agreement and contracts entered into with associated enterprises or with unrelated enterprises in respect of transactions similar to the international transactions or the specified domestic transactions as the case may be; (f) segmented financial statements in accordance with the Accounting standards as prescribed;"

[Rule 10D(3)] 7.86 Rule 10D(3) provides that the information compiled, kept and maintained by the enterprise, under clauses (a) to (m) of sub-rule (1), shall, to the extent possible, be further supported by “authentic” documents that provide additional information of the nature specified therein. Most of the information required to be provided is global or macro in nature. 7.87 The above documents are required to substantiate the functional and economic analysis performed by the enterprise. The Accountant shall review the contents of the functional and economic analysis and shall verify whether the enterprise has maintained back-up data listed above to substantiate the facts and figures given in the documents listed in Rule 10D(1). Contemporaneity of data 7.88 The information and documents specified under sub-rules (1), (2), and (2A), should, as far as possible, be contemporaneous and should exist latest by the specified date referred to in clause (iv) of section 92F: Provided that where an international transaction or specified domestic transaction continues to have effect over more than one previous year, fresh documentation need not be maintained separately in respect of each previous year, unless there is any significant change in the nature of terms of the international transaction or specified domestic transaction, in the assumptions made, or in any other factor which could influence the transfer price, and in case of such significant change, fresh documentation as may be necessary under sub-rules (1), (2) and (2A) shall be maintained bringing out the impact of the change on the pricing of the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction.

"Documentation and Verification 205 7.89 The Accountant may design a questionnaire and conduct interviews with the client personnel (wherever necessary) to understand if the enterprise has taken due diligence with regard to maintaining documentation. The Accountant should determine whether any changes have occurred in the business conditions under which the enterprise was operating. The enquiries may cover the following areas: • changes in business and pricing strategy;  • changes in market conditions [demand / supply] in India and in the country where the associated enterprise is located; • changes in the “key” value drivers of the industry; • changes in the critical success factors that influence the company’s position in the market; • changes in competition; • changes in terms of contract; • changes in sales volumes / total revenues arising as a result of the international transactions. 7.90 The above exercise would assist the Accountant in evaluating the appropriateness of the functional / economic analysis undertaken by the Assessee. 7.91 In case the changes above, are not likely to influence the economic analysis conducted in the earlier year/years, the enterprise’s role may be limited to the following: • examine whether comparability analysis of the earlier year continues to be applicable [a comparable uncontrolled transaction in the earlier year may now have become a controlled transaction due to certain changes in the business conditions; a comparable company selected in the earlier year may now have started transacting with associated enterprises; etc. ].This is more relevant for transactions whose pricing basis as well the computation mechanism remain changed over a period of time (say royalty arrangements). • update the financial analysis using the fresh list of comparables [after rejecting companies / transactions that are no longer comparable] and using the financial information for the current year [this is because, the Indian economy cannot still be considered a stable"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 206 economy and prices and profit levels may fluctuate significantly from year to year]. • determine the arm’s length price for the current year using the result of the financial analysis conducted in the current year. 7.92 Rule 10D (4) provides that the data, information and documents on the basis of which the arm’s length price has been determined should, as far as possible, be contemporaneous. At any rate, they should exist by no later than the specified date by which the report under section 92E is required to be furnished. Where the international transaction / specified domestic transaction has longevity that spans one or more previous years, the enterprise need not prepare fresh documentation in respect of the transactions conducted in every subsequent previous years. 7.93 However, when there is a significant change in the nature or terms of the international transaction or specified domestic transaction, in the assumptions made, or in any other factor, which could influence the transfer price, then fresh documentation, as appropriate, should be made to bring out the impact of the changes on the pricing of the international transaction. 7.94 The information and documents required to be maintained under section 10D shall be preserved for a period of eight years from the end of the relevant assessment year. This provision assumes significance in view of the penal and other consequences attracted due to non-production of the information and documents kept and maintained. Reference is drawn to CBDT Circular No.12 dated 23.08.2001 (Annexure IV) relaxing this requirement for transactions entered into during the period from 1.4.2001 to 31.8.2001.

"Chapter 8 Penalties Introduction To ensure the compliances with regard to transfer pricing provisions, various penalty provisions are provided in the law. As per Para 4.5 of OECD TP Guidelines 2017, the three aspects which often impact on how tax administrations determine their administrative response to ensure compliances with their own transfer pricing rules are: examination practices, the burden of proof, and penalty system. Para 4.19 of OECD TP Guidelines 2017 provides that no-fault penalty is against the principles of legal systems of many jurisdictions. The Indian Income-tax Act provides the following penalties for non-compliance of transfer pricing provisions. Penalty for concealment of income or furnishing inaccurate particulars thereof1 8.1 The erstwhile section 271(1)(c)(iii) provides that if the Assessing Officer or the Commissioner (Appeals) or the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner is satisfied that any person has concealed the particulars of his income or furnished inaccurate particulars of such income, he may direct that such person shall pay by way of penalty, in addition to any tax payable by him, a sum which shall not be less than, but which shall not exceed three times, the amount of tax sought to be evaded by reason of the concealment of particulars of his income or the furnishing of inaccurate particulars of such income. 8.2 Explanation 7, was inserted to the aforesaid section by Finance Act, 2001 with effect from April 1, 2002.This explanation is invoked only when any amount is added or disallowed in computing the total income under section 92C(4).The explanation provides that the amount added/disallowed under this section (i.e., any addition on account of international transaction) shall be deemed to represent the income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished. 1 Omitted vide Finance Act 2016"
"Penalties 213 8.3 The explanation creates a rebuttable presumption of concealment or furnishing of inaccurate particulars. The burden of rebuttal is on the assessee and it does not shift to the Department. The assessee is required to prove that he has acted in good faith and with due diligence. If it is so proved, the addition/disallowance shall not be deemed to represent concealed income/inaccurate furnishing of particulars of income. 8.4 While Section 273B states that no penalty shall be imposed if the assessee proves that there was a reasonable cause for the said failure, however given that the provisions of section 273B do not apply to a penalty under section 271(1)(c), the assessee must discharge the burden laid down in Explanation 7 only to contest the non-imposition of penalty under the said section. 8.5 For non-imposition of the penalty under this section, the explanation requires the assessee to prove that the price charged or paid was computed in good faith and with due diligence. 8.6 The aforesaid section was further amended with effect from FY 2012-13 to include therein the reference of specified domestic transactions. Penalty for under reporting and misreporting of income 8.7 Section 271(1)(c) was deleted by the Finance Act 2016 and in its place section 270A was inserted which is applicable from 1 April 2017. It seeks to levy penalty for under-reporting and misreporting of income. 8.8 Section 270A (7) of the Act prescribes a penalty of 50% of the amount of tax payable on the under-reported income. Further, Section 270A(6)(d) provides that the under-reported income for the purpose of Section 270A shall not include the amount of under-reported income represented by any addition made in conformity with the arm's length price determined by the Transfer Pricing Officer, where the assessee had: a)  maintained information and documents as prescribed under section 92D,  b)  declared the international transaction under Chapter X, and,  c)  disclosed all the material facts relating to the transaction. 8.9  Section 270A(8) of the Act provides that where under-reported income is in consequence of any misreporting thereof by any person, the penalty shall be equal to two hundred per cent of the amount of tax payable"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 214 on under-reported income. Section 270A(9)(f) of the Act provides that the case of misreporting of income shall include failure to report any international transaction or any transaction deemed to be an international transaction or any specified domestic transaction, to which the provisions of Chapter X apply. Immunity from imposition of penalty 8.10  Section 270AA was inserted by the Finance Act 2016 which is applicable from 1 April 2017. It seeks to grant immunity from imposition of penalty. 8.11  Section 270AA provides that an assessee may make an application to the Assessing Officer to grant immunity from imposition of penalty under section 270A, where the assessee had (a) paid the tax and interest payable as per the order of assessment or reassessment under sub-section (3) of section 143 or section 147 within the period specified in notice of demand, and, (b)  no appeal against the order referred to in clause (a) has been filed. Section 270AA(2) of the Act provides that application shall be made within one month from the end of the month in which the order referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) has been received and shall be made in such form as prescribed. 8.12 The immunity is granted only after fulfilment of the conditions specified in Section 270AA(1) of the Act and after the expiry of the period of filing the appeal as specified in clause (b) of sub-section (2) of section 249. No immunity is granted in case of any proceedings for penalty initiated under the circumstances referred to in sub-section (9) of the said section 270A i.e., for under-reporting as a consequence of misreporting. Penalty for failure to keep and maintain information and documents in respect of international transaction or specified domestic transaction 8.13 Section 271AA relates to penalty for failure to keep and maintain information and document in respect of international transactions or specified domestic transactions. Section 271AA was substituted by a new section with effect from 1-7-2012. It provides that without prejudice to the provisions of section 270A or section"
"Penalties 215 271 or Section 271BA, if any person in respect of an international transaction or specified domestic transaction: (a)  fails to keep and maintain prescribed documents and information as required by sub-section (1)or sub-section (2) of section 92D; (b)  fails to report any such transaction which is required to be reported; or (c)  maintains or furnishes any incorrect information or documents the Assessing Officer or Commissioner (Appeals) may direct that such person shall pay, by way of penalty, a sum equal to two percent of the value of each international transaction/Specified domestic transaction entered into by such person. Further, Section 271AA(2) inserted vide Finance Act 2016 prescribes penalty for failure to furnish master file by the prescribed due date as INR 5,00,000. 8.14 The above provision is without prejudice to section 270A or section 271 and Section 271BA and is invoked when ‘any person’ fails to keep and maintain any such information and document as required by section 92D (1) and (2) or fails to report any international transaction/ specified domestic transaction or maintains or furnishes any incorrect information or documents. 8.15 Thus, whether or not an international transaction or specified domestic transaction is determined at arm’s length price, any person who has entered into such transaction, shall keep and maintain the information/document in respect of such transaction. 8.16 The penalty is invoked for failure to keep and maintain such information/documents or report the same. In other words, the person who has entered into international transaction or specified domestic transaction should both keep as well as maintain such information/documents as well as report the same. Any failure in respect of the same attracts a penalty of 2% of the value of each international transaction or specified domestic transaction entered into by him. Also, this penalty would be in addition to the penalties in section 271BA (i.e., Penalty for failure to furnish report under section 92E) and 271G (Penalty for failure to furnish information or document under section 92D)."

"Chapter 9 Scope of Examination under  Section 92E Report under section 92E 9.1 According to section 92E every person who has entered into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction during a previous year shall obtain a report from an Accountant and furnish such report on or before the specified date in the prescribed form duly signed and verified in the prescribed manner by such Accountant and setting forth such particulars as may be prescribed. The report is to be given by an Accountant in Form No.3CEB as prescribed under Rule 10E.The Income Tax rules have been amended to require the filing of the said report to be done electronically. The scope, as envisaged by section 92E, is restricted to  examination of accounts and records of the Assessee relating to the international transaction or specified domestic transaction entered into by the Assessee during the previous year under examination. 9.2 Further, the Accountant has to give his opinion whether “proper information and documents as are prescribed” have been kept by the Assessee in respect of the international transactions or specified domestic transaction entered into by him. The examination under section 92E is not an audit requiring opinion of the Accountant on the true and fair view of the financial statements of the enterprise. 9.3 The report consists of three paragraphs dealing with distinct aspects as summarised hereunder: The first paragraph contains declaration about examination of the accounts and records of the Assessee in order to review the international transaction(s) and the specified domestic transaction(s). The second paragraph involves rendering of an opinion whether proper information and documents as are prescribed under Rule 10D are maintained by the Assessee in respect of the identified international transactions and the specified domestic transaction(s), on the basis of the details furnished in Annexure to Form No.3CEB."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 220 The third and the last paragraph requires expression of the opinion whether the particulars given in the Annexure to Form No.3CEB are true and correct. 9.4 Examination of accounts and records Form No.3CEB *I/we have examined the accounts and records of ……………….. (name and address of the Assessee with PAN) relating to the international transaction(s) and the specified domestic transactions entered into by the Assessee during the previous year ending on 31st March, ………. [Paragraph 1] 9.5 The expression “accounts and records” appearing in the report should normally refer to those accounts and records which are to be examined solely in relation to the international transactions and the specified domestic transactions entered into by the Assessee during the relevant previous year. As the expression “accounts and records” are limited to those pertaining to international transactions and the specified domestic transactions only, the said report does not require the Accountant to certify the true and fair view of the financial statements of the enterprise. Therefore, he should restrict his examination to such details and matters that in his opinion are sufficient to determine whether proper documents have been maintained with respect to international transactions and the specified domestic transactions and whether the particulars disclosed in the annexure are true and correct. The extent of examination of the said accounts and records is a matter of professional judgment of the Accountant. However, while the Accountant is expected to make specific inquiries as regards various matters that are the subject of the Form No 3CEB, his work often comprises checking, by the application of materiality principles and on a test basis, the evidence supporting the information presented in the Form No 3CEB. Particularly in cases where the Accountant is relying on financial statements of the Assessee audited by another auditor, it is reasonable to rely on the correctness of information contained in such audited financial statements, including as regards its completeness, unless there are any obvious or significant discrepancies. In the event of such discrepancies, the Accountant would need to obtain necessary information, explanations and reconciliations as may be required from the Assessee, and report on that basis. The Accountant can rely upon the values of the international transactions and the specified transactions reported in the financial statements / tax audit"
"Scope of Examination under Section 92E  221 report of the Company. However, the auditor should undertake due diligence to assess the reasonableness of the value reported therein (by undertaking test checks) and also obtain a representation from the management of the company in this regard. 9.6 The Accountant should obtain from the Assessee a complete list of “accounts and records” maintained by him (both financial and non-financial records) and identify those that need to be produced before him for examination. He should further obtain suitable representation as regards the completeness of the “accounts and records” from the Assessee. 9.7 Where the certifying Accountant is not the statutory auditor of the Assessee he should take the precaution of clearly stating in his report that the figures from the audited general purpose financial statements have been used and relied upon. The Accountant may obtain a written representation from the Assessee on the reconciliation between the figures appearing in his report and the figures appearing in the general-purpose financial statements (as provided in the “Guidance Note on Reports and Certificates for Special Purposes” (Revised 2016)). Further, the Accountant can clearly state that he has relied upon the work performed by the other auditors. 9.8 In conducting the review and examination the Accountant will have to use his professional skill and expertise and apply such audit tests as the circumstances of the case may require. He may apply such tests/sampling techniques as may be deemed proper depending on the internal control procedures followed by the Assessee. The Accountant will also have to keep in mind the concept of materiality depending on the circumstances of each case. He would be well advised to refer to Standards on Auditing as well as the guidance notes issued by the Institute. 9.9 Ensuring completeness of the listing of international transactions and specified domestic transactions is the responsibility of the Assessee. The Assessee should maintain a comprehensive detail of every international transaction and specified domestic transaction. The Accountant should use his professional skill and expertise and apply such tests as the circumstances of the case may require to examine whether the same meets the requirement of law. Further, in relation to the deemed international transactions, the primary responsibility of identification / analyzing such transaction rests with the assesse. It is worthwhile to note that w.e.f. FY 2014-15, transactions of the assesse with an Indian company are also covered within the ambit of ‘deemed international transaction’. The Accountant should obtain a representation from the management of the"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 222 Assessee as to completeness of the listing of such transactions. However, the Accountant should exercise his professional judgment in this regard. 9.10 The Accountant should obtain a written representation from the Assessee providing him with the name, address, legal status and country of tax residence of each of the enterprises with whom international transactions and the specified domestic transactions have been entered into by the Assessee, and association linkages among them. 9.11 Maintenance of proper information and documents “2. In *my/our opinion proper information and documents as are prescribed have been kept by the Assessee in respect of the international transaction(s) and the specified domestic transactions entered into so far as appears from *my/our examination of the records of the Assessee”. 9.12 In paragraph 2 of the report the Accountant is required to give his opinion on the Assessee’s compliance with the documentation requirements prescribed under Rule 10D.The Accountant should review the documents and records pertaining to international transactions and the specified domestic transactions of the Assessee and compare the same with those prescribed under Rule 10D to form an opinion. 9.13 If the Accountant is satisfied that specified records have been properly maintained by the Assessee then the certification may be done without any qualification. If any document is not maintained or if any qualification or a note as part of emphasis on matter is given in the financial statement by the statutory auditor of the Assessee, then the Accountant should suitably qualify his report or disclose the same in his report depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The Accountant should state the qualification in the report making it comprehensive and self-explanatory. In this regard the Accountant should follow principles enshrined in the SA 700(Revised) “Forming an Opinion and Reporting on Financial Statements”, SA 705 (Revised) Modifications to the Opinion in the Independent Auditor’s Report and SA 706 (Revised) Emphasis of Matters Paragraphs and Other Matter Paragraphs in the Independent Auditor’s Report. 9.14 An Assessee in whose case the aggregate value of international transaction as recorded in the books of account does not exceed INR1 crore in aggregate, there is a relief provided under sub-rule (2) of Rule 10D from maintaining the specified information and documents. However, the proviso thereunder necessitates such an Assessee to substantiate that income or"
"Scope of Examination under Section 92E  223 expense as the case may be arising from international transactions has been computed in accordance with section 92 on the basis of material in his possession. Therefore, the Accountant should verify in such cases whether there is any material available with the Assessee in this regard and if available the details thereof needs to be examined. The Accountant shall, in such cases, express his opinion with or without qualification by exercising his professional judgement after verification of the material produced for such examination. The said rule does not provide any such relief by way of monetary threshold for the purposes of maintaining the information and documents in respect of the specified domestic transactions. Accordingly, where the aggregate of the specified domestic transactions during a previous year exceeds Rs. 20 crores, there would be an obligation to maintain specified information and documents as per sub rule (1) of Rule 10D. 9.15 Certification regarding particulars in Annexure “3. The particulars required to be furnished under section 92E are given in the Annexure to this Form. In *my/our opinion and to the best of my/our information and according to the explanations given to *me/us, the particulars given in the Annexure are true and correct”. 9.16 Paragraph 3 of Form No.3CEB provides that the particulars required to be furnished under section 92E are given in the Annexure to this Form and whether in the Accountant’s opinion and to the best of his information and according to the explanations given to him, they are true and correct. As mentioned above, the particulars should be obtained from the Assessee, duly authenticated, which should be reviewed by the Accountant. In case of any negative remark or qualification about this matter, the same should be properly reported. 9.17 The Accountant must limit his scope of work and the review procedures to the extent certified in Form No.3CEB.For e.g. in the Annexure the method which has been used to determine the arm’s length price needs to be stated. In this context the Accountant is only required to ensure that the method stated as being used to determine the arm’s length price by the Assessee has actually been used and it is not the Accountant’s responsibility to ensure that the method so used is the most appropriate method as prescribed by the Board."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 224 9.18 The Accountant may mention in the report, wherever necessary, that the correctness has been ensured only to the extent that the Accountant has carried out an examination and further that the certificate is subject to the notes stated against the relevant clauses or Annexure to Form No.3CEB. 9.19 The statutory auditor of the Assessee has to report that the financial statements audited by him give a ‘true and fair’ view. The requirement in paragraph 3 of Form No.3CEB relating to particulars in Annexure to Form No.3CEB is that the Accountant should report that these particulars are “true and correct”. The terminology “true and fair” is widely understood though not defined even by the Companies Act, 2013.On the other hand, the words “true and correct” lay emphasis on factual accuracy of the information. In this context reference is invited to AS-1 and AS(IT)-I relating to disclosure of accounting policies. These standards recognise that the major considerations governing the selection and application of accounting policies are (i) prudence, (ii) substance over form and (iii) materiality. Therefore, while examining the particulars in the Annexure to Form No.3CEB these aspects should be kept in view. In particular, considering the nature of particulars to be examined in the Annexure to Form No.3CEB, the aspect of materiality should be considered. In other words qualifications may be given only in respect of material items as envisaged by the Accountant. Other aspects Online filing of Form 3CEB  9.20 From AY 2012-13, CBDT has made it mandatory for enterprises to file their Form 3CEB online, with a view to make the process faster and less error prone. However, the online filing mode does not provide for a facility for documenting notes by the Accountant in each of the relevant clauses or Annexure to Form No.3CEB. 9.21 In order to document the position adopted while certifying the Form 3CEB, the Accountant may issue a memo / written document to the enterprise presenting his/ her notes against the relevant clauses or Annexure to Form No.3CEB. The Assessee thereafter at his discretion may consider filing the Form 3CEB along with the notes applicable to the relevant clauses or Annexure to Form No. 3CEB, with the Indian tax department to support the position adopted while filing Form No. 3CEB online by an Accountant."

Data which is not relevant may not be required to be maintained. The Accountant should rely on his professional judgement to verify the relevance and the extent of details available with the permanent establishment as per Rule 10D(1) in order to establish the arm’s length price. Annexure to Form No.3CEB 9.23 The statement of particulars given in the Annexure to Form No.3CEB contains twenty five clauses. The Accountant has to report whether the particulars furnished in Form No.3CEB are true and correct. 9.24 As stated earlier, the Accountant should obtain a duly authenticated statement of particulars in Annexure to Form No.3CEB from the Assessee. It would be advisable for the Assessee to take into consideration the following general principles while preparing the Annexure:  (a) He can rely upon the judicial pronouncements while taking any particular view about inclusion or exclusion of any items in the particulars to be furnished under any of the clauses specified in the Annexure. (b) If there is a conflict of judicial opinion on any particular issue, he may refer to the view, which has been followed while giving the particulars under any specified clause.

(b) Nature of the relationship with the associated enterprise as referred to in section 92A(2). (c) Brief description of the business carried on by the associated enterprise. 9.36 The Assessee is required to furnish by way of an attachment, a complete list of associated enterprises, duly certified by the authorised person (partner, trustee, managing director etc. depending on the definition of Assessee) with whom the Assessee has entered into international transactions during the previous year. The terms ‘associated enterprises’ and ‘international transactions’ have been defined in detail in sections 92A and 92B of the Act, respectively. If an enterprise was ‘associated’ with the Assessee for a part of the previous year, details should be furnished with respect to that period of the previous year. In this connection, the Assessee has to maintain a register with the list of the transactions and the relevant details. The Accountant can rely on the information provided in the register of associated enterprise for completing his work. 9.37 The particulars in this clause should be examined on test check basis from an instrument or agreement or any other document evidencing the association of enterprises including any supplementary documents related thereto. In this connection the Accountant has to, based on his best judgement, determine the sampling approach and design the nature and timing of the audit tests. 9.38 In preparing the list of the associated enterprises, it is possible that the extent of association may not be precisely ascertainable during the previous year, i.e. it may be indeterminate or unknown, resulting in a situation whereby the Assessee is not in a position to conclude as to whether any particular entity is covered under the definition of ‘associated enterprise’, as detailed in section 92A of the Act. In such circumstances, it is advisable both from the viewpoint of the Assessee and the Accountant’s perspective that the relevant fact be stated in the Annexure or in the notes, as the case may be, and reference to same be made, if considered significant, in the"

The Assesse could source required data from the master file or CbC report, wherever applicable. 9.39 In certain cases the enterprises may be associated in more than one manner. Since there is no different treatment for any particular form of association, it may be sufficient if the Assessee details any particular relationship with the associated enterprise under clause 10(b).Although the Assessee may be advised to detail all the relationships, disclosure of any one relationship is considered sufficient from a compliance perspective. 9.40 The Accountant should obtain a written representation from the Assessee detailing the business of the associated enterprises with whom the Assessee has transacted. Further, since the completeness of the list of the associated enterprises and transactions with them is the primary responsibility of the Assessee, the Accountant should obtain suitable written representation from the management (Board of directors or its equivalent). 9.41 The Accountant may be advised to use his professional skill and expertise, in determining the scope of work to be performed with respect of getting reasonable comfort on the Assessee’s list of international transactions with associated enterprises. The Accountant should, however, be aware of the possibility that transactions with associated enterprises may have been influenced in large measure by conditions similar to the following:- (a) Lack of sufficient working capital or credit to continue the business; (b) An urgent desire for a continued favorable earnings record in the hope of supporting the price of the Assessee’s share price, if any; (c) An overly optimistic earnings forecast; (d) Dependence on a single or relatively few products, customers, or transactions for the continuing success of the venture; (e) A declining industry characterised by a large number of business failures; (f) Excess capacity; (g) Significant litigation, especially litigation between stockholders and management; or (h) Significant obsolescence dangers because the Assessee is in a high-technology industry. 9.42 The Accountant should place emphasis on test checking material transactions with enterprises associated to the Assessee.

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 240 constitutes a deemed international transaction has already been provided in Para 4.5 and Para 4.6 above. The Assessee is required to furnish details such as description of the transaction, amount paid/ payable or received/ receivable, and the method used for determination of arm’s length price. 9.57 The Accountant should examine the information provided by the  Assessee, with the documents as he considers essential in  connection with the details of nature and terms (including prices) of  international transactions entered into with each associated  enterprise, details of property transferred or services provided and  the quantum and the value of each such transaction or class of such  transaction. 9.58 The Accountant should examine the information provided in the annexure by the Assessee, by using standard examining practices from the books of account maintained by the Assessee and from information and explanations obtained. He should also verify the information provided by the Assessee in the context of the understanding that he has of the Assessees business. Further, in conducting the examination the Accountant will have to use his professional skill and expertise and apply such tests, based on materiality and sampling, as the circumstances of the case may require. 9.59 For verifying the correctness of the: (i) ‘name and address of the associated enterprise with whom the international transaction has been entered into’, and (ii) ‘description of transaction and quantity purchased/sold’ the Accountant may examine any instrument or agreement or any other document (invoices, correspondence etc.) evidencing the transaction and may also verify the books of account of the Assessee. 9.60 For determining the correctness of the, ‘total amount paid/ received or payable/receivable in the transaction as per books of account’ the Accountant may, in addition to examining the information/documents detailed above, obtain a confirmation for material international transactions from each associated enterprise, if considered essential. Such confirmation may be undertaken to obtain evidence from third parties about assertions made by the Assessee in the annexure. In general, it is presumed that when evidential matter can be obtained from independent sources outside an entity, it provides greater assurance of reliability for the purposes of an independent examination than that secured solely within the entity."
"Scope of Examination under Section 92E  241 9.61 Confirmation requests can be designed to elicit evidence that addresses the completeness assertion: that is, if properly designed, confirmations may provide evidence to aid in assessing whether all transactions, accounts and amounts that should be included in the annexure are included. The Accountant may require the identified associated enterprise to seek confirmation from associated parties, the following with respect to the transactions entered into with the Assessee: (a) description of transaction and quantity purchased/sold; (b) total amount paid/received or payable/receivable in the transaction; and (c) listing of all transactions without consideration, if any. Additionally, obtaining of a confirmation from the associated enterprise would be more advisable in the event that the financial statements / books of account of the Assessee are yet to be audited. 9.62 With regard to the, ‘total amount paid/received or payable/ receivable in the transaction as computed by the Assessee having regard to the arm’s length price’, the Accountant should get an authenticated declaration from the Assessee along with a computation statement regarding the total amount paid/received or payable/receivable in the transaction as well as the arm’s length price as computed by the Assessee. 9.63 With regard to the, ‘method used for determining the arm’s length price’, the Accountant is at no point of time required to suggest the most appropriate method to determine the arm’s length price nor is he required to assign any value to any transaction. As stated earlier, the computation of the arm’s length prices and the selection of the most appropriate method is the responsibility of the Assessee and the Accountant only needs to verify the same to ensure that they are in accordance with the accounts and records maintained by the Assessee and that the same are true and correct. 9.64 Clauses 11 to 18 and clause 20 of Annexure to Form No.3CEB list typical transactions that generally take place.

Further, it is advisable to take a representation from the management stating that all international transaction / specified domestic transactions, whether specifically stated in the Form No.3CEB or not, have been disclosed to the Accountant. 9.66 Form No. 3CEB requires the Accountant, who signs the report, to indicate his membership number.

The list of associated enterprises must be duly certified by the authorised person (partner, trustee, managing director etc. depending on the definition of Assessee). The term ‘associated enterprises’ has been defined in detail in Rule 10A of the Rules. If an enterprise was ‘associated’ with the Assessee for a part of the previous year, details should be furnished with respect to that period of the previous year. In this connection, the Assessee has to maintain a register with the list of the transactions and the relevant details.

"Scope of Examination under Section 92E  243 thereto. In this connection the Accountant has to, based on his best judgement, determine the sampling approach and design the nature and timing of the audit tests. 9.70 In preparing the list of the associated enterprises, it is possible that the extent of association may not be precisely ascertainable during the previous year, i.e. it may be indeterminate or unknown, resulting in a situation whereby the Assessee is not in a position to conclude as to whether any particular entity is covered under the definition of ‘associated enterprise’, as detailed in Rule 10A. In such circumstances, it is advisable both from the viewpoint of the Assessee and the Accountant’s perspective that the relevant fact be stated in the Annexure or in the notes, as the case may be, and reference to same be made, if considered significant, in the Accountant’s report. 9.71 In certain cases the enterprises may be associated in more than one manner. Since there is no different treatment for any particular form of association, it may be sufficient if the Assessee details any particular relationship with the associated enterprise under clause 21(b). Although the Assessee may be advised to detail all the relationships, disclosure of any one relationship is considered sufficient from a compliance perspective. 9.72 The Accountant should obtain a written representation from the Assessee detailing the business of the associated enterprises with whom the Assessee has transacted. Further, since the completeness of the list of the associated enterprises is the primary responsibility of the Assessee, the Accountant should obtain suitable representation from the management (Board of directors or its equivalent). 9.73 The Accountant should use his professional skill and expertise, in determining the scope of work to be performed with respect of getting reasonable comfort on the Assessee’s list of specified domestic transactions with associated enterprises. 9.74 The Accountant should place emphasis on test checking material transactions with enterprises associated to the Assessee. Certain relationships, such as parent-subsidiary or investor-investee, may be clearly evident. Determining the existence of others requires the application of certain procedures, which may include the following: (a) Evaluate the Assessee procedures for identifying and properly accounting for specified domestic transactions;"

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 286 (3) Where an enterprise has undertaken comparable uncontrolled transactions in more than one financial year, then for the purposes of sub-rule (2) the weighted average of the prices of such transactions shall be computed in the following manner, namely:-  (i) where the prices have been determined using the method referred to in clause (b) of sub-rule (1) of rule 10 B, the weighted average of the prices shall be computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of sales which has been considered for arriving at the respective prices;  (ii)  where the prices have been determined using the method referred to in clause (c) of sub-rule (1) of rule 10 B, the weighted average of the prices shall be computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of costs which has been considered for arriving at the respective prices;  (iii)  where the prices have been determined using the method referred to in clause (e) of sub-rule (1) of rule 10 B, the weighted average of the prices shall be computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of costs incurred or sales effected or assets employed or to be employed, or as the case may be, any other base which has been considered for arriving at the respective prices. (4)  Where the most appropriate method applied is a method other than the method referred to in clause (d) or clause (f) of sub-section (1) of section 92 C and the dataset constructed in accordance with sub-rule (2) consists of six or more entries, an arm’s length range beginning from the thirty-fifth percentile of the dataset and ending on the sixty-fifth percentile of the dataset shall be constructed and the arm’s length price shall be computed in accordance with sub-rule(5) and sub-rule (6). (5) If the price at which the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken is within the range referred to in sub-rule (4), then, the price at which such international transaction or the specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken shall be deemed to be the arm’s length price. (6) If the price at which the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken is outside the arm's length range referred to in sub-rule (4), the arm’s length price shall be taken to be the median of the dataset."
"Annexure II 287 (7) In a case where the provisions of sub-rule (4) are not applicable, the arm's length price shall be the arithmetical mean of all the values included in the dataset:   Provided that, if the variation between the arm's length price so determined and price at which the international transaction or specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken does not exceed such percentage not exceeding three percent. of the latter, as may be notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette in this behalf, the price at which the international transaction or specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken shall be deemed to be the arm's length price. (8)  For the purposes of this rule,-  (a) “the thirty-fifth percentile” of a dataset, having values arranged in an ascending order, shall be the lowest value in the dataset such that at least thirty five percent. of the values included in the dataset are equal to or less than such value :    Provided that, if the number of values that are equal to or less than the aforesaid value is a whole number, then the thirty-fifth percentile shall be the arithmetic mean of such value and the value immediately succeeding it in the dataset ;  (b)  “the sixth-fifth percentile” of a dataset, having values arranged in an ascending order, shall be the lowest value in the dataset such that at least sixty five percent. of the values included in the dataset are equal to or less than such value:   Provided that, if the number of values that are equal to or less than the aforesaid value is a whole number, then the sixty-fifth percentile shall be the arithmetic mean of such value and the value immediately succeeding it in the dataset;  (c) “the median” of the dataset, having values arranged in an ascending order, shall be the lowest value in the dataset such that at least fifty percent. of the values included in the dataset are equal to or less than such value :   Provided that, if the number of values that are equal to or less than the aforesaid value is a whole number, then the median shall be the arithmetic mean of such value and the value immediately succeeding it in the dataset."

No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Values  2.2% 6% 8.2% 9% 10.57% 11.9% 12% For construction of the arm’s length range the data place of thirty-fifth and sixty-fifth percentile shall be computed in the following manner, namely:   Total no. of data points in dataset * (35/100)   Total no. of data points in dataset * (65/100) Thus, the data place of the thirty-fifth percentile = 7*0.35 = 2.45. Since this is not a whole number, the next higher data place, i.e; the value at the third place would have at least thirty five percent. of the values below it. The thirty-fifth percentile is therefore value at the third place, i.e, 8.2%. The data place of the sixth-fifth percentile is = 7*0.65 = 4.55. Since this is not a whole number, the next higher data place, i.e; the value at the fifth place would have at least sixty five percent. of the values below it. The sixty-fifth percentile is therefore value at fifth place, i.e, 10.57%. The arm’s length range will be beginning at 8.2% and ending at 10.57%. Therefore, if the transaction price of the international transaction or the specified domestic transaction has OP/OC percentage which is equal to or more than 8.2% and less than or equal to 10.57%, it is within the range. The transaction price in such cases will be deemed to be the arm’s length price and no adjustment shall be required. However, if the transaction price is outside the arm’s length range, say 6.2%, then for the purpose of determining the arm’s length price the median of the dataset shall be first determined in the following manner:  The data place of median is calculated by first computing the total number of data point in the data set * (50/100). In this case it is 7 * 0.5 = 3.5. Since this is not a whole number, the next higher data place, i.e; the value at the fourth place would have at least fifty percent. of the values below it (median). The median is the value at fourth place, i.e., 9%."
"Therefore, the arm’s length price shall be considered as 9% and adjustment shall accordingly be made. Illustration 2.

"     Annexure III Extracts from the Memorandum explaining the relevant provisions of the respective Finance Bill(s)  1. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2001. Measures to curb tax avoidance New Legislation to curb tax avoidance by abuse of transfer pricing “The increasing participation of multinational groups in economic activities in the country has given rise to new and complex issues emerging from transactions entered into between two or more enterprises belonging to the same multinational group. The profits derived by such enterprises carrying on business in India can be controlled by the multinational group, by manipulating the prices charged and paid in such intra-group transactions, thereby, leading to erosion of tax revenues. With a view to provide a statutory framework which can lead to computation of reasonable, fair and equitable profits and tax in India, in the case of such multinational enterprises, new provisions are proposed to be introduced in the Income-tax Act. These provisions relate to computation of income from international transactions having regard to the arm’s length price, meaning of associated enterprise, meaning of international transaction, determination of arm’s length price, keeping and maintaining of information and documents by persons entering into international transactions, furnishing of a report from an accountant by persons entering into such transactions and definitions of certain expressions occurring in the said sections.” 2. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2002. Clarification regarding provisions of Transfer Pricing “Under the existing provisions contained in section 92 of the Income-tax Act, any income arising from an international transaction shall be computed having regard to the arm’s length price. The intention underlying the provision is to prevent avoidance of tax by shifting taxable income to a jurisdiction outside India, through abuse of transfer pricing. With a view to clarify this intention, it is proposed to"
"Annexure III 371 substitute the section so as to provide that even where the international transaction comprises of only an outgoing, the allowance for such expenses or interest arising from the international transaction shall also be determined having regard to the arm’s length price, and that the provision would not be applicable in a case where the application of arm’s length price results in a downward revision in the income chargeable to tax in India. The existing provision contained in section 92A of the Income-tax Act to provide as to when two enterprises shall be deemed to be associated enterprises. It is proposed to amend sub-section (2) of the said section to clarify that the mere fact of participation by one enterprise in the management or control or capital of the other enterprise, or the participation of one or more persons in the management or control or capital of both the enterprises shall not make them associated enterprises, unless the criteria specified in sub-section (2) are fulfilled. Under the existing provisions contained in the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 92C of the Income-tax Act, if the application of the most appropriate method leads to determination of more than one price, the arithmetical mean of such prices shall be taken to be the arm’s length price in relation to the international transaction. With a view to allow a degree of flexibility in adopting an arm’s length price, it is proposed to amend the proviso to sub-section (2) of the said section to provide that where the most appropriate method results in more than one price, a price which differs from the arithmetical mean by an amount not exceeding five per cent of such mean may be taken to be the arm’s length price, at the option of the assessee. Under the existing provisions contained in the second proviso to sub-section (4) of section 92C, where the total income of an enterprise is computed by the Assessing Officer on determination of the arm’s length price paid to the associated enterprise from which tax has been deducted under the provisions of Chapter XVII-B, the income of the associated enterprise shall not be recomputed by reason of such determination of arm’s length price in the case of the first mentioned enterprise. It is proposed to amend the said second proviso to clarify that the provisions contained therein apply not only in a case where tax has been deducted under Chapter XVII-B, but also in cases where such tax was deductible, even if not actually deducted."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 372 Section 92F of the Income-tax Act provides definitions of certain terms relevant to computation of arm’s length price. It is proposed to amend the definition of ‘enterprise’ contained therein so as to include the business of construction as one of the activities in which an enterprise may be engaged, and to provide a separate definition of permanent establishment on the lines of the definition found in tax treaties entered into by India, and to amend the definition of “specified date” to provide that it shall have the same meaning as assigned to ""due date” for furnishing of return.” These amendments being of clarificatory nature will take effect retrospectively from 1st April, 2002 and will accordingly, apply to the assessment year 2002-03 and subsequent years. 3. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2006. Rationalisation of provisions relating to Transfer Pricing The existing provisions contained in section 92C provide for computation of arm’s length price. Sub-section (2) of the said section provides that the most appropriate method shall be applied for computation of arm’s length price. Sub-section (3) of the said section lays down the conditions under which the Assessing Officer can determine the arm’s length price in a case. Under sub-section (4) it has been provided that on the basis of the arm’s length price so determined, the Assessing Officer may compute the total income of an assessee. The first proviso to sub-section (4) provides that where the total income of an assessee as compute by the Assessing Officer is higher than the income declared by the assessee, no deduction under section 10A or section 10B or under Chapter VI-A shall be allowed into respect of the amount of income by which the total income of the assessee is enhance after computation of income under this sub-section. Sections 10A and 10B provide deductions in respect of the profits and gains derived from exports. Section 10AA also provides for deduction of profits and gains derived from exports, in respect of newly established units in Special Economic Zones. With a view to rationalize the provisions of sub-section (4) of section 92C, it is proposed to amend the first proviso to the said sub-section so as to provide that no deduction under section 10AA shall be allowed in respect of the amount of income by which the total income of the assessee is enhanced after computation of income under sub-section (4). This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2007and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2007- 08 and subsequent years."
"Annexure III 373 4. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2007. Extension of Time limitation for making assessment where a reference is made to the Transfer Pricing Officer Under the existing provisions of the Income-tax Act, there is no extra time available to the Assessing Officer for competing the assessment or reassessment in cases where a reference is made by him under sub-section 92CA to the Transfer Pricing Officer for determination of the Arm’s length price of an international transaction. Since the time limit for selection of cases for scrutiny is one year from the end of the month in which the return was filed, references to Transfer Pricing Officers are made mostly after one year of filing of the return. Thus, Transfer Pricing Officers are not getting adequate time to make a meaningful audit of transfer price in cases referred to them. With a view that the Transfer Pricing Officers as well as the Assessing Officers get sufficient time to make the audit of transfer price and the assessment in cases involving international transactions, it has been proposed to revise the time limits specified in sections 153 and 153B for making the assessment or reassessment in cases where a reference has been made to the Transfer Pricing Officer. The revised time limits in such cases shall be the time limits specified under the aforesaid sections, as increased by twelve months. It is further proposed to provide that the Transfer Pricing Officer shall determine the Arm’s length pricing at least two months before the expiry new statutory time limit for making the assessment or reassessment. Under the existing provisions of sub-section (4) of section 92CA, it has been provided that on receipt of the order under sub-section (3) of said section, the Assessing Officer shall proceed to compute the total income of the assessee under sub-section (4) of section 92C having regard to the Arm’s length price determined under sub-section (3) by the Transfer Pricing Officer. It has been proposed to amend said sub-section (4) of section 92CA so as to provide that, on receipt of the order under sub-section (3) of section 92CA, the Assessing Officer shall proceed to compute the total income of the assessee under sub-section (4) of section 92C in conformity with the Arm’s length price determine under sub-section (3) of section 92CA by the Transfer Pricing Officer. These amendments will take effect from 1st June, 2007and shall also be applicable in cases where a reference to the Transfer Pricing Officer was"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 374 made prior to 1.7.2007 but the Transfer Pricing Officer did not pass the order under sub-section (3) section 92CA before the said date. 5. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill (No. 2), 2009. Determination of arm's length price in cases of international transactions  Section 92C of the Income-tax Act provides for adjustment in the transfer price of an international transaction with an associated enterprise if the transfer price is not equal to the arm's length price. As a result, a large number of such transactions are being subjected to adjustment giving rise to considerable dispute. Therefore, it is proposed to empower the Board to formulate safe harbour rules i.e. to provide the circumstances in which the Income-tax authorities shall accept the transfer price declared by the assessee. This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2009. Further, the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 92C provides that where more than one price is determined by the most appropriate method, the arm’s length price shall be taken to be the arithmetical mean of such prices, or, at the option of the assessee, a price which may vary from the arithmetical mean by an amount not exceeding five per cent of such arithmetical mean. The above provision has been subject to conflicting interpretation by the assessee and the Income Tax Department. The assessee’s view is that the arithmetical mean should be adjusted by 5 per cent to arrive at the arm's length price. However, the department’s contention is that if the variation between the transfer price and the arithmetical mean is more than 5 per cent of the arithmetical mean, no allowance in the arithmetical mean is required to be made. With a view to resolving this controversy, it is proposed to amend the proviso to section 92C to provide that where more than one price is determined by the most appropriate method, the arm’s length price shall be taken to be the arithmetical mean of such price. However, if the arithmetical mean, so determined, is within five per cent of the transfer price, then the transfer price shall be treated as the arm's length price and no adjustment is required to be made. This amendment will take effect from 1st October, 2009 and shall accordingly apply in relation to all cases in which proceedings are pending before the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) on or after such date."
"Annexure III 375 Provision for constitution of alternate dispute resolution mechanism The dispute resolution mechanism presently in place is time consuming and finality in high demand cases is attained only after a long drawn litigation till Supreme Court. Flow of foreign investment is extremely sensitive to prolonged uncertainity in tax related matter. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the Income-tax Act to provide for an alternate dispute resolution mechanism which will facilitate expeditious resolution of disputes in a fast track basis. The salient features of the proposed alternate dispute resolution mechanism are as under:— (1)  The Assessing Officer shall, forward a draft of the proposed order of assessment (hereinafter in this section referred to as the draft order) to the eligible assessee if he proposes to make, on or after the 1st day of October, 2009, any variation in the income or loss returned which is prejudicial to the interest of such assessee. (2)  On receipt of the draft order, the eligible assessee shall, within thirty days of the receipt by him of the draft order,- (a)  File his acceptance of the variations to the Assessing Officer; or (b)  File his objections, if any, to such variation with,—  (i)  The Dispute Resolution Panel; and  (ii)  The Assessing Officer. (3)  The Assessing Officer shall complete the assessment on the basis of the draft order, if — (a)  The assessee intimates to the Assessing Officer the acceptance of the variation; or (b)  No objections are received within the period specified in sub-section (2). (4)  The Assessing Officer shall, notwithstanding anything contained in section 153, pass the assessment order under sub-section (3) within one month from the end of the month in which,— (a)  The acceptance is received; or (b)  The period of filing of objections under sub-section (2) expires."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 376 (5)  The Dispute Resolution Panel shall, in a case where any objections are received under sub-section (2), issue such directions, as it thinks fit, for the guidance of the Assessing Officer to enable him to complete the assessment. (6)  The Dispute Resolution Panel shall issue the directions referred to in sub-section (5), after considering the following, namely:— (a)  Draft order; (b)  Objections filed by the assessee; (c)  Evidence furnished by the assessee; (d)  Report, if any, of the Assessing Officer, Valuation Officer or Transfer Pricing Officer or any other authority; (e)  Records relating to the draft order; (f)  Evidence collected by, or caused to be collected by, it; and (g)  Result of any enquiry made by, or caused to be made by it. (7)  The Dispute Resolution Panel may, before issuing any directions referred to in sub-section (5), - (a)  Make such further enquiry, as it thinks fit; or (b)  Cause any further enquiry to be made by any income tax authority and report the result of the same to it. (8)  The Dispute Resolution Panel may confirm, reduce or enhance the variations proposed in the draft order so, however, that it shall not set aside any proposed variation or issue any direction under sub-section (5) for further enquiry and passing of the assessment order. (9)  If the members of the Dispute Resolution Panel differ in opinion on any point, the point shall be decided according to the opinion of the majority of the members. (10)  Every direction issued by the Dispute Resolution Panel shall be binding on the Assessing Officer. (11)  No direction under sub-section (5) shall be issued unless an opportunity of being heard is given to the assessee and the Assessing Officer on such directions which are prejudicial to the interest of the assessee or the interest of the revenue, respectively. (12)  No direction under sub-section (5) shall be issued after nine months from the end of the month in which the draft order is forwarded to the eligible assessee."
"Annexure III 377 (13)  Upon receipt of the directions issued under sub-section (5), the Assessing Officer shall, in conformity with the directions, complete, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 153, the assessment without providing any further opportunity of being heard to the assessee, within one month from the end of the month in which the direction is received. (14)  The Board may make rules for the efficient functioning of the Dispute Resolution Panel and expeditious disposal of the objections filed, under sub-section(2), by the eligible assessee. (15)  For the purposes of this section,— (a)  “Dispute Resolution Panel” means a collegium comprising of three commissioners of Income-tax constituted by the Board for this purpose; (b)  “eligible assessee” means,- (i)  any person in whose case the variation referred to in sub-section (1) arises as a consequence of the order of the Transfer Pricing Officer passed under sub-section (3) of section 92CA; and (ii)  any foreign company. Further, it is proposed to make consequential amendments— (i)  in sub-section (1) of section 131 so as to provide that “Dispute Resolution Panel” shall have the same powers as are vested in a Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908); (ii)  in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 246 so as to exclude the order of assessment passed under sub-section (3) of section 143 in pursuance of directions of “Dispute Resolution Panel” as an appealable order and in clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 246 so as to exclude an order passed under section 154 of such order as an appealable order; (iii)  in sub-section (1) of section 253 so as to include an order of assessment passed under sub-section (3) of section 143 in pursuance of directions of “Dispute Resolution Panel” as an appealable order. These amendments will take effect from 1st October, 2009."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 378 6. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2011. Rationalisation of provisions relating to Transfer Pricing A. Section 92C of the Income-tax Act provides the procedure for computation of the Arm’s Length Price (ALP). The section provides the methods of computing the ALP and mandates that the most appropriate method should be chosen to compute ALP. It is also provided that if more than one price is determined by the chosen method, the ALP shall be taken to be the arithmetical mean of such prices. The second proviso to section 92C(2) provides that if the variation between the actual price of the transaction and the ALP, as determined above, does not exceed 5% of the actual price, then, no adjustment will be made and the actual price shall be treated as the ALP. A fixed margin of 5% across all segments of business activity and range of international transactions has out-lived its utility. It is, therefore, proposed to amend section 92C of the Act to provide that instead of a variation of 5%, the allowable variation will be such percentage as may be notified by Central Government in this behalf. This amendment is proposed to take effect from 1st April, 2012 and it shall accordingly apply in relation to the Assessment Year 2012-13 and subsequent years. B. Section 92CA of the Act provides that the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) can determine the ALP in relation to an international transaction, which has been referred to the TPO by the Assessing Officer. It is proposed to amend section 92CA so as to specifically provide that the jurisdiction of the Transfer Pricing Officer shall extend to the determination of the ALP in respect of other international transactions, which are noticed by him subsequently, in the course of proceedings before him. These international transactions would be in addition to the international transactions referred to the TPO by the Assessing Officer. C.  Section 92CA(7) provides that for the purpose of determining the ALP, the TPO can exercise powers available to an assessing officer under section 131(1) and section 133(6). These are powers of summoning or calling for details for the purpose of inquiry or investigation into the matter. In order to enable the TPO to conduct on-the-spot enquiry and verification, it is proposed to amend section 92CA(7) so as to enable the TPO to also exercise the power of survey conferred upon an income-tax authority under section 133A of the Act."
"Annexure III 379 These amendments are proposed to take effect from 1st June 2011. D.  Section 139 of the Income-tax Act stipulates 30th September of the assessment year as the due date for filing of return of income in case of corporate assessees. In addition to filing a return of income, assessees who have undertaken international transactions are also required (under the provisions of section 92E) to prepare and file a transfer pricing report in Form 3CEB before the due date for filing of return of income. Corporate assessees face practical difficulties in accessing contemporary comparable data before 30th September in order to furnish a report in respect of their international transactions. It is, therefore, proposed to amend section 139 to extend the due date for filing of return of income by such corporate assessees to 30th November of the assessment year. This amendment is proposed to take effect from 1st April 2011. 7. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2012. Rationalization of Transfer Pricing Provisions Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) Advance Pricing Agreement is an agreement between a taxpayer and a taxing authority on an appropriate transfer pricing methodology for a set of transactions over a fixed period of time in future. The APAs offer better assurance on transfer pricing methods and are conducive in providing certainty and unanimity of approach. It is proposed to insert new sections 92CC and 92CD in the Act to provide a framework for advance pricing agreement under the Act. The proposed sections provide the following. – 1. It empowers Board, to enter into an advance pricing agreement with any person undertaking an international transaction. 2. Such APAs shall include determination of the arm’s length price or specify the manner in which arm’s length price shall be determined, in relation to an international transaction which the person undertake. 3. The manner of determination of arm’s length price in such cases shall be any method including those provided in subsection (1) of section 92C, with necessary adjustments or variations. 4. The arm’s length price of any international transaction, which is covered under such APA, shall be determined in accordance with the APA so entered and the provisions of section 92C or section 92CA"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 380 which normally apply for determination of arm’s length price would be modified to this extent and arm’s length price shall be determined in accordance with APA. 5. The APA shall be valid for such previous years as specified in the agreement which in no case shall exceed five consecutive previous years. 6. The APA shall be binding only on the person and the Commissioner (including income-tax authorities subordinate to him) in respect of the transaction in relation to which the agreement has been entered into. The APA shall not be binding if there is any change in law or facts having bearing on such APA. 7. The Board is empowered to declare, with the approval of Central Government, any such agreement to be void ab initio, if it finds that the agreement has been obtained by the person by fraud or misrepresentation of facts. Once an agreement is declared void ab-initio, all the provisions of the Act shall apply to the person as if such APA had never been entered into. 8. For the purpose of computing any period of limitation under the Act, the period beginning with the date of such APA and ending on the date of order declaring the agreement void ab-initio shall be excluded. However, if after the exclusion of the aforesaid period, the period of limitation referred to in any provision of the Act is less than sixty days, such remaining period shall be extended to sixty days. 9. The Board is empowered to prescribe a Scheme providing for the manner, form, procedure and any other matter generally in respect of the advance pricing agreement. 10. Where an application is made by a person for entering into such an APA, proceedings shall be deemed to be pending in the case of the person for the purposes of the Act like for making enquiries under section 133(6) of the Act. 11. The person entering in to such APA shall necessarily have to furnish a modified return within a period of three months from the end of the month in which the said APA was entered in respect of the return of income already filed for a previous year to which the APA applies. The modified return has to reflect modification to the income only in respect of the issues arising from the APA and in accordance with it."
"Annexure III 381 12. Where the assessment or reassessment proceedings for an assessment year relevant to the previous year to which the agreement applies are pending on the date of filing of modified return, the Assessing Officer shall proceed to complete the assessment or reassessment proceedings in accordance with the agreement taking into consideration the modified return so filed and normal period of limitation of completion of proceedings shall be extended by one year. 13. If the assessment or reassessment proceedings for an assessment year relevant to a previous year to which the agreement applies has been completed before the expiry of period allowed for furnishing of modified return,the Assessing Officer shall, in a case where modified return is filed, proceed to assess or reassess or recompute the total income of the relevant assessment year having regard to and in accordance with the APA and to such assessment, all the provisions relating to assessment shall apply as if the modified return is a return furnished under section 139 of the Act. The period of limitation for completion of such assessment or reassessment is one year from the end of the financial year in which the modified return is furnished. 14. All the other provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly as if the modified return is a return furnished under section 139. These amendments will take effect from 1st July, 2012. Examination by the Transfer Pricing Officer of international transactions not reported by the Assessee Section 92CA of the Act provides that the Assessing Officer, if he considers it necessary or expedient to do so, may with the previous approval of Commissioner of Income tax, refer the matter of determination of Arm’s Length Price in respect of an international transaction to the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO). Once reference is made to the TPO, TPO is competent to exercise all powers that are available to the Assessing Officer under sub-section (3) of Section 92C for determination of ALP and consequent adjustment. Further under section 92E of the Act, there is reporting requirement on the taxpayer and the taxpayer is under obligation to file an audit report in prescribed form before the Assessing Officer (AO) containing details of all international transactions undertaken by the taxpayer during the year. This audit report is the primary document with the Assessing Officer, which contains the details of international transactions undertaken by the taxpayer."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 382 If the assessee does not report such a transaction in the report furnished under section 92E then the Assessing Officer would normally not be aware of such an International Transaction so as to make a reference to the Transfer Pricing Officer. The Transfer Pricing Officer may notice such a transaction subsequently during the course of proceeding before him. In absence of specific power, the determination of Arm’s Length Price by the Transfer Pricing Officer would be open to challenge even though the basis of such an action is non-reporting of transaction by the taxpayer at first instance. It is proposed to amend the section 92CA of the Act retrospectively to empower Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) to determine Arm’s Length Price of an international transaction noticed by him in the course of proceedings before him, even if the said transaction was not referred to him by the Assessing Officer, provided that such international transaction was not reported by the taxpayer as per the requirement cast upon him under section 92E of the Act. This amendment will take effect retrospectively from 1st June, 2002. It is also proposed to provide an explanation to effect that due to retrospectivity of the amendment no reopening of any proceeding would be undertaken only on account of such an amendment. This amendment will take effect from 1st July, 2012. Transfer Pricing Regulations to apply to certain domestic transactions Section 40A of the Act empowers the Assessing Officer to disallow unreasonable expenditure incurred between related parties. Further, under Chapter VI-A and section 10AA, the Assessing Officer is empowered to re-compute the income (based on fair market value) of the undertaking to which profit linked deduction is provided if there are transactions with the related parties or other undertakings of the same entity. However, no specific method to determine reasonableness of expenditure or fair market value to re-compute the income in such related transactions is provided under these sections. The Supreme Court in the case of CIT Vs. Glaxo SmithKline Asia (P) Ltd., in its order has, after examining the complications which arise in cases where fair market value is to be assigned to transactions between domestic related parties, suggested that Ministry of Finance should consider appropriate provisions in law to make transfer pricing regulations applicable to such related party domestic transactions."
"Annexure III 383 The application and extension of scope of transfer pricing regulations to domestic transactions would provide objectivity in determination of income from domestic related party transactions and determination of reasonableness of expenditure between related domestic parties. It will create legally enforceable obligation on assessees to maintain proper documentation. However, extending the transfer pricing requirements to all domestic transactions will lead to increase in compliance burden on all assessees which may not be desirable. Therefore, the transfer pricing regulations need to be extended to the transactions entered into by domestic related parties or by an undertaking with other undertakings of the same entity for the purposes of section 40A, Chapter VI-A and section 10AA. The concerns of administrative and compliance burden are addressed by restricting its applicability to the transactions, which exceed a monetary threshold of `5 crores in aggregate during the year. In view of the circumstances which were present in the case before the Supreme Court, there is a need to expand the definition of related parties for purpose of section 40A to cover cases of companies which have the same parent company. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Act to provide applicability of transfer pricing regulations (including procedural and penalty provisions) to transactions between related resident parties for the purposes of computation of income, disallowance of expenses etc. as required under provisions of sections 40A, 80-IA, 10AA, 80A, sections where reference is made to section 80-IA, or to transactions as may be prescribed by the Board, if aggregate amount of all such domestic transactions exceeds Rupees 5 crore in a year. It is further proposed to amend the meaning of related persons as provided in section 40A to include companies having the same holding company. This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2013 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the Assessment Year 2013-14 and subsequent assessment years. Determination of Arm’s Length Price (ALP) I. Section 92C of the Act provides for computation of arms lengths price. Sub-section (1) of this section provides the set of methods for determination of arm’s length price and mandates application of the most appropriate method for determination of arm’s length price (ALP). Sub-Section (2) of section 92C provides that where more than one price is determined by application of most appropriate method, the arm’s length price shall be taken"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 384 to be the arithmetic mean of such prices. The proviso to this sub-section was inserted by Finance Act, 2002 with effect from 01.04.2002 to ensure that in case variation of transaction price from the arithmetic mean is within the tolerance range of 5%, no adjustment was required to be made to transaction value. Subsequently, disputes arose regarding the interpretation of the proviso. Whether the tolerance band is a standard deduction or not, in case variation of ALP and transaction value exceeded the tolerance band. Different courts interpreted it differently. In order to bring more clarity and resolving the controversy the proviso was substituted by Finance Act (No.2), 2009. The substituted proviso not only made clear the intent that 5% tolerance band is not a standard deduction but also changed the base of determination of the allowable band, linked it to the transaction price instead of the earlier base of Arithmetic mean. The amendment clarified the ambiguity about applicability of 5% tolerance band, not being a standard deduction. However, the position prior to amendment by Finance (No.2) Act, 2009 still remained ambiguous with varying judicial decisions. Some favouring departmental stand and others the stand of tax payer. There is, therefore, a need to bring certainty to the issue by clarifying the legislative intent in respect of first proviso to sub-section (2) which was inserted by the Finance Act, 2002. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Income Tax Act to provide clarity with retrospective effect in respect of first proviso to section 92C(2) as it stood before its substitution by Finance Act (No.2), 2009 so that the tolerance band of 5% is not taken to be a standard deduction while computing Arm’s Length Price and to ensure that due to such retrospective amendment already completed assessments or proceedings are not reopened only on this ground. The amendments proposed above shall be effective retrospectively from 1st April, 2002 and shall accordingly apply in relation to the Assessment Year 2002-03 and subsequent Assessment Years. II. In respect of amendment, which was brought by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2009, the explanatory memorandum clearly mentioned the legislative intent of the amended provision to be applicable to all proceedings pending as on 01.10.2009 before the Transfer Pricing Officer. However, subsequent decisions of certain judicial authorities have created doubts about"
"Annexure III 385 applicability of this proviso to proceedings pending as on 01.10.2009. There is need to clarify the legislative intent of making the proviso applicable for all assessment proceedings pending as on 01.10.2009 instead of it being attracted only in respect of proceeding for assessment year 2010-11 and subsequent assessment years. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Income Tax Act to provide clarity that second proviso to section 92C shall also be applicable to all proceedings which were pending as on 01.10.2009. The date of coming in force of second proviso inserted by Finance (No.2) Act, 2009. The amendments will take effect retrospectively from 1st October, 2009. Filing of return of income, definition of international transaction, tolerance band for ALP, penalties and reassessment in transfer pricing cases  Section 139 of the Act provides for due date of filing return of income in case of various categories of persons. In addition to filing of return of income, the assesses who have undertaken international transactions are also required to prepare and file a Transfer Pricing report in Form 3CEB, as per Section 92E of the Act, before the due date of filing of return of income. Vide the Finance Act, 2011 the due date for filing of return of income in case of corporate assesses who were required to obtain and file Transfer Pricing report (required under section 92E of the Act), was extended to 30th November of the assessment year. It has been noted that assesses other than companies are also faced with similar constraints of absence of sufficient contemporary data in public domain by 30th September which is currently the due date of filing of return of income and Transfer Pricing report in their cases. Therefore, there is a need to extend the due date for filing of return of income in case of non-corporate taxpayers, who have undertaken international transactions and are required to obtain and file Transfer Pricing report as per Section 92E of the Act. The due date of filing of return of income in case of non-corporate assesses be extended to 30th November of the assessment year. It is proposed to amend Section 139 of the Act, to provide that in case of all assesses who are required to obtain and file Transfer Pricing report as per Section 92E of the Act, the due date would be 30th November of the assessment year."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 386 This amendment will take effect retrospectively from 1st April, 2012 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2012-13 and subsequent assessment years. Section 92B of the Act, provides an exclusive definition of International Transaction. Although, the definition is worded broadly, the current definition of International Transaction leaves scope for its misinterpretation. The definition by its concise nature does not mention all the nature and details of transactions, taking benefit of which large number of International Transactions are not being reported by taxpayers in transfer pricing audit report. In the definition, the term “intangible property” is included. Still, due to lack of clarity in respect of scope of intangible property, the taxpayer have not reported several such transactions. Certain judicial authorities have taken a view that in cases of transactions of business restructuring etc. where even if there is an international transaction Transfer Pricing provisions would not be applicable if it does not have bearing on profits or loss of current year or impact on profit and loss account is not determinable under normal computation provisions other than transfer pricing regulations. The present scheme of Transfer pricing provisions does not require that international transaction should have bearing on profits or income of current year. Therefore, there is a need to amend the definition of international transaction in order to clarify the true scope of the meaning of the term. “international transaction” and to clarify the term “intangible property” used in the definition. It is, therefore, proposed to amend section 92B of the Act, to provide for the explanation to clarify meaning of international transaction and to clarify the term intangible property used in the definition of international transaction and to clarify that the ‘international transaction’ shall include a transaction of business restructuring or reorganisation, entered into by an enterprise with an associated enterprise, irrespective of the fact that it has bearing on the profit, income, losses or assets or such enterprises at the time of the transaction or at any future date. This amendment will take effect retrospectively from 1st April, 2002 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2002-03 and subsequent assessment years. Section 92C provides methods for determination of Arm’s Length Price (ALP). Sub section (1) of the said section prescribes the methods of computation of Arm’s Length Price. Sub section (2) of the said sub section"
"Annexure III 387 provides that if the appropriate method results in more than one price then the arithmetic mean of these prices would be the ALP. The proviso to sub section (2) of section 92C which was amended by Finance Act, 2011 provides that the Central Government may notify a percentage and if variation between the ALP so determined and the transaction price is within the notified percentage (of transaction price), no adjustment shall be made to the transaction price. There is a need to put an upper ceiling on such tolerance range, which is to be notified, in the legislation. It is, therefore, proposed to amend Section 92C (2) of the Act, so as to provide an upper ceiling of 3% in respect of power of Central Government to notify the tolerance range for determination of arms length price. This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2013 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2013-14 and subsequent assessment years. Section 271BA of the Income Tax Act provides a penalty of `  1 lakh in cases where any person fails to furnish a report from an accountant as required by Section 92E. Section 271AA provides penalty for failure to keep and maintain information and document in respect of International Transaction. Section 271G provides penalty for failure to furnish information or document under Section 92D which requires maintenance of certain information and documents in the prescribed proforma by persons entering into an International Transaction. The above scheme of penalty provisions allows for misuse of provisions due to lack of effective deterrent. In order to suppress information about international transactions, some taxpayers may not furnish the report or get the Transfer Pricing audit done. The meager penalty of ` 1 lakh as compared to the quantum of international transactions is not an effective deterrent. There is presently no penalty for non-reporting of an international transaction in report filed under section 92E or maintenance or furnishing of incorrect information or documents. Therefore, there is need to provide effective deterrent based on transaction value to enforce compliance with Transfer Pricing regulations. It is, therefore, proposed to amend Section 271AA to provide levy of a penalty at the rate of 2% of the value of the international transaction, if the taxpayer.-"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 388 i. fails to maintain prescribed documents or information or; ii. fails to report any international transaction which is required to be reported, or; iii. maintains or furnishes any incorrect information or documents. This penalty would be in addition to penalties in section 271BA and 271G. This amendment will take effect from 1st July, 2012. Section 147 of the Act, provides for reopening of the cases of the previous years, if any income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. Explanation to this section provides certain circumstances where it will be deemed that income has escaped assessments. Under the Act, income from an international transactions has to be computed in accordance with arm’s length principle and transfer pricing provisions apply to such transactions. Therefore, in each and every case of international transaction, the income arising from such transaction has to be tested against the benchmark of arm’s length price. In certain transactions, transaction value is at arm’s length price and no adjustment takes place whereas in others it may lead to adjustments. If an international transaction is not reported by the assessee, such transaction never gets benchmarked against arm’s length principle. It is, therefore, imperative that non-reporting of international transactions should lead to a presumption of escapement of income. It is, therefore, proposed to amend Section 147 of the Act, to provide that in all cases where it is found that an international transaction has not been reported either by non-filing of report or otherwise by not including such transaction in the report mentioned in section 92E then such non-reporting would be considered as a case of deemed escapement of income and such a case can be reopened under section 147 of the Act. This amendment will take effect from 1st July, 2012. Appeal against the directions of the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) The institution of Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) was created by Finance Act, 2009 with a view to bring about speedy resolution of disputes in the case of international transactions particularly involving Transfer Pricing issues. Under the provisions of sub-section (8) of section 144C, the DRP has the power to confirm, reduce or enhance the variations proposed in the draft order. The Income Tax Department does not have the right to appeal against"
"Annexure III 389 the directions given by the DRP. The taxpayer has been given a right to appeal directly to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) against the order passed by the Assessing Officer in pursuance of the directions of the DRP. As the directions given by the DRP are binding on the Assessing Officer, it is accordingly proposed to provide that the Assessing Officer may also file an appeal before the ITAT against an order passed in pursuance of directions of the DRP. It is therefore proposed to amend the provisions of section 253 and section 254 of the Income-tax Act to provide for filing of appeal by the Assessing Officer against an order passed in pursuance of directions of the DRP in respect of an objection filed on or after 1st July, 2012. These amendments will take effect from the 1st day of July, 2012. Power of the DRP to enhance variations Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) had been constituted with a view to expeditiously resolve the cases involving transfer pricing issues in the case of any person having international transactions or in case of a foreign company. It has been provided under sub-section (8) of section 144C that DRP may confirm, reduce or enhance the variations proposed in the draft order of the Assessing Officer. In a recent judgement, it was held that the power of DRP is restricted only to the issues raised in the draft assessment order and therefore it cannot enhance the variation proposed in the order as a result of any new issue which comes to the notice of the panel during the course of proceedings before it. This is not in accordance with the legislative intent. It is accordingly proposed to insert an Explanation in the provisions of section 144C to clarify that the power of the DRP to enhance the variation shall include and shall always be deemed to have included the power to consider any matter arising out of the assessment proceedings relating to the draft assessment order. This power to consider any issue would be irrespective of the fact whether such matter was raised by the eligible assessee or not. This amendment will be effective retrospectively from the 1st day of April, 2009 and will accordingly apply to assessment year 2009-10 and subsequent assessment years."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 390 Completion of assessment in search cases referred to DRP Under the provisions of section 144C of the Income-tax Act where an eligible assessee files an objection against the draft assessment order before the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP), then, the time limit for completion of assessments are as provided in section 144C notwithstanding anything in section 153. A similar provision is proposed to be made where assessments are framed as a result of search and seizure to provide that for such assessments, time limit specified in section 144C will apply, notwithstanding anything in section 153B. It is also proposed to provide for exclusion of such orders passed by the Assessing Officer in pursuance of the directions of the DRP, from the appellate jurisdiction of the Commissioner (Appeals) and to provide for filing of appeals directly to ITAT against such orders. Accordingly, consequential amendments are proposed to be made in the provisions of section 246A and 253 of the Income-tax Act. These amendments in the provisions of the Income-tax Act will take effect retrospectively from the 1st day of October, 2009. 8. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance (No.2) Act, 2014 Roll back provision in Advance Pricing Agreement Scheme Section 92CC of the Act provides for Advance Pricing Agreement (APA). It empowers the Central Board of Direct Taxes, with the approval of the Central Government, to enter into an APA with any person for determining the Arm’s Length Price (ALP) or specifying the manner in which ALP is to be determined in relation to an international transaction which is to be entered into by the person. The agreement entered into is valid for a period, not exceeding 5 previous years, as may be mentioned in the agreement. Once the agreement is entered into, the ALP of the international transaction, which is subject matter of the APA, would be determined in accordance with such an APA. In many countries the APA scheme provides for “roll back” mechanism for dealing with ALP issues relating to transactions entered into during the period prior to APA. The “roll back” provisions refers to the applicability of the methodology of determination of ALP, or the ALP, to be applied to the international transactions which had already been entered into in a period prior to the period covered under an APA. However, the “roll back” relief is provided on case to case basis subject to certain conditions. Providing of"
"Annexure III 391 such a mechanism in Indian legislation would also lead to reduction in large scale litigation which is currently pending or may arise in future in respect of the transfer pricing matters. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the Act to provide roll back mechanism in the APA scheme. The APA may, subject to such prescribed conditions, procedure and manner, provide for determining the arm’s length price or for specifying the manner in which arm’s length price is to be determined in relation to an international transaction entered into by a person during any period not exceeding four previous years preceding the first of the previous years for which the advance pricing agreement applies in respect of the international transaction to be undertaken in future. This amendment will take effect from 1st October, 2014. Rationalisation of the Definition of International Transaction The existing provisions of section 92B of the Act define 'International transaction' as a transaction in the nature of purchase, sale, lease, provision of services, etc. between two or more associated enterprises, either or both of whom are non-residents. Sub-section (2) of the said section extends the scope of the definition of international transaction by providing that a transaction entered into with an unrelated person shall be deemed to be a transaction with an associated enterprise, if there exists a prior agreement in relation to the transaction between such other person and the associated enterprise, or the terms of the relevant transaction are determined in substance between the other person and the associated enterprise. The sub-section as presently worded has led to a doubt whether or not, for the transaction to be treated as an international transaction, the unrelated person should also be a non-resident. Therefore, it is proposed to amend section 92B of the Act to provide that where, in respect of a transaction entered into by an enterprise with a person other than an associated enterprise, there exists a prior agreement in relation to the relevant transaction between the other person and the associated enterprise or, where the terms of the relevant transaction are determined in substance between such other person and the associated enterprise, and either the enterprise or the associated enterprise or both of them are non-resident, then such transaction shall be deemed to be an international transaction entered into between two associated enterprises, whether or not such other person is a non-resident."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 392 This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2015 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2015-16 and subsequent assessment years. Levy of Penalty under section 271G by Transfer Pricing Officers The existing provisions of section 271G of the Act provide that if any person who has entered into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction fails to furnish any such document or information as required by sub-section (3) of section 92D, then such person shall be liable to a penalty which may be levied by the Assessing Officer or the Commissioner (Appeals). Section 92CA provides that an Assessing Officer may make reference to a Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) for determination of arm's length price (ALP). TPO has been defined in the said section to mean a Joint Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner who is authorised by the Board to perform all or any of the functions of an Assessing Officer specified in sections 92C and 92D. The determination of arm’s length price in several cases is done by the TPO. It is, therefore, proposed to amend section 271G of the Act to include TPO, as referred to in Section 92CA, as an authority competent to levy the penalty under section 271G in addition to the Assessing Officer and the Commissioner (Appeals). This amendment will take effect from 1st October, 2014. 9. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Act, 2015 Raising the threshold for specified domestic transaction The existing provisions of section 92BA of the Act define “specified domestic transaction” in case of an assessee to mean any of the specified transactions, not being an international transaction, where the aggregate of such transactions entered into by the assessee in the previous year exceeds a sum of five crore rupees. In order to address the issue of compliance cost in case of small businesses on account of low threshold of five crores rupees, it is proposed to amend section 92BA to provide that the aggregate of specified transactions entered into by the assessee in the previous year should exceed a sum of twenty crore rupees for such transaction to be treated as ‘specified domestic transaction’. This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2016 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2016-17 and subsequent assessment years."
"Annexure III 393 10. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2016 BEPS action plan - Country-By-Country Report and Master File Sections 92 to 92F of the Act contain provisions relating to transfer pricing regime. Under provision of section 92D, there is requirement for maintenance of prescribed information and document relating to the international transaction and specified domestic transaction. The OECD report on Action 13 of BEPS Action plan provides for revised standards for transfer pricing documentation and a template for country-by-country reporting of income, earnings, taxes paid and certain measure of economic activity. India has been one of the active members of BEPS initiative and part of international consensus. It is recommended in the BEPS report that the countries should adopt a standardised approach to transfer pricing documentation. A three-tiered structure has been mandated consisting of:- (i)  a master file containing standardised information relevant for all multinational enterprises (MNE) group members; (ii)  a local file referring specifically to material transactions of the local taxpayer; and (iii)  a country-by-country report containing certain information relating to the global allocation of the MNE's income and taxes paid together with certain indicators of the location of economic activity within the MNE group. The report mentions that taken together, these three documents (country-by-country report, master file and local file) will require taxpayers to articulate consistent transfer pricing positions and will provide tax administrations with useful information to assess transfer pricing risks. It will facilitate tax administrations to make determinations about where their resources can most effectively be deployed, and, in the event audits are called for, provide information to commence and target audit enquiries. The country-by-country report requires multinational enterprises (MNEs) to report annually and for each tax jurisdiction in which they do business; the amount of revenue, profit before income tax and income tax paid and accrued. It also requires MNEs to report their total employment, capital, accumulated earnings and tangible assets in each tax jurisdiction. Finally, it requires MNEs to identify each entity within the group doing business in a particular tax jurisdiction and to provide an indication of the business activities each entity engages in. The Country-by-Country (CbC) report has"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 394 to be submitted by parent entity of an international group to the prescribed authority in its country of residence. This report is to be based on consolidated financial statement of the group. The Master File is intended to provide an overview of the MNE groups business, including the nature of its global business operations, its overall transfer pricing policies, and its global allocation of income and economic activity in order to assist tax administrations in evaluating the presence of significant transfer pricing risk. In general, the master file is intended to provide a high-level overview in order to place the MNE group's transfer pricing practices in their global economic, legal, financial and tax context. The master file shall contain information which may not be restricted to transaction undertaken by a particular entity situated in particular country. In that aspect, information in master file would be more comprehensive than the existing regular transfer pricing documentation. The master file shall be furnished by each entity to the tax authority of the country in which it operates. In order to implement the international consensus, it is proposed to provide a specific reporting regime in respect of CbC reporting and also the master file. It is proposed to include essential elements in the Act while remaining aspects can be detailed in rules. The elements relating to CbC reporting requirement and matters related to it proposed to be included through amendment of the Act are:— (i)  the reporting provision shall apply in respect of an international group having consolidated revenue above a threshold to be prescribed. (ii)  the parent entity of an international group, if it is resident in India shall be required to furnish the report in respect of the group to the prescribed authority on or before the due date of furnishing of return of income for the Assessment Year relevant to the Financial Year (previous year) for which the report is being furnished; (iii)  the parent entity shall be an entity which is required to prepare consolidated financial statement under the applicable laws or would have been required to prepare such a statement, had equity share of any entity of the group been listed on a recognized stock exchange in India; (iv)  every constituent entity in India, of an international group having parent entity that is not resident in India, shall provide information regarding the country or territory of residence of the parent of the"
"Annexure III 395 international group to which it belongs. This information shall be furnished to the prescribed authority on or before the prescribed date; (v)  the report shall be furnished in prescribed manner and in the prescribed form and would contain aggregate information in respect of revenue, profit & loss before Income-tax, amount of Income-tax paid and accrued, details of capital, accumulated earnings, number of employees, tangible assets other than cash or cash equivalent in respect of each country or territory along with details of each constituent's residential status, nature and detail of main business activity and any other information as may be prescribed. This shall be based on the template provided in the OECD BEPS report on Action Plan 13; (vi)  an entity in India belonging to an international group shall be required to furnish CbC report to the prescribed authority if the parent entity of the group is resident ;- (a)  in a country with which India does not have an arrangement for exchange of the CbC report; or (b)  such country is not exchanging information with India even though there is an agreement; and (c)  this fact has been intimated to the entity by the prescribed authority; (vii)  If there are more than one entities of the same group in India, then the group can nominate (under intimation in writing to the prescribed authority) the entity that shall furnish the report on behalf of the group. This entity would then furnish the report; (viii)  If an international group, having parent entity which is not resident in India, had designated an alternate entity for filing its report with the tax jurisdiction in which the alternate entity is resident, then the entities of such group operating in India would not be obliged to furnish report if the report can be obtained under the agreement of exchange of such reports by Indian tax authorities; (ix)  The prescribed authority may call for such document and information from the entity furnishing the report for the purpose of verifying the accuracy as it may specify in notice. The entity shall be required to make submission within thirty days of receipt of notice or further period if extended by the prescribed authority, but extension shall not be beyond 30 days;"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 396 (x)  For non-furnishing of the report by an entity which is obligated to furnish it, a graded penalty structure would apply:- (a)  if default is not more than a month, penalty of `5000/- per day applies; (b)  if default is beyond one month, penalty of `15000/- per day for the period exceeding one month applies; (c)  for any default that continues even after service of order levying penalty either under (a) or under (b), then the penalty for any continuing default beyond the date of service of order shall be @ `50,000/- per day; (xi)  In case of timely non-submission of information before prescribed authority when called for, a penalty of `5000/- per day applies. Similar to the above, if default continues even after service of penalty order, then penalty of `50,000/- per day applies for default beyond date of service of penalty order; (xii)  If the entity has provided any inaccurate information in the report and,- (a)  the entity knows of the inaccuracy at the time of furnishing the report but does not inform the prescribed authority; or (b)  the entity discovers the inaccuracy after the report is furnished and fails to inform the prescribed authority and furnish correct report within a period of fifteen days of such discovery; or (c)  the entity furnishes inaccurate information or document in response to notice of the prescribed authority, then penalty of ` 500,000/- applies; (xiii)  The entity can offer reasonable cause defence for non-levy of penalties mentioned above. The proposed amendment in the Act in respect of maintenance of Master File and furnishing it are: - (i)  the entities being constituent of an international group shall, in addition to the information related to the international transactions, also maintain such information and document as is prescribed in the rules. The rules shall thereafter prescribe the information and document as mandated for master file under OECD BEPS Action 13 report; (ii)  the information and document shall also be furnished to the prescribed authority within such period as may be prescribed"
"Annexure III 397 and the manner of furnishing may also be provided for in the rules; (iii)  for non-furnishing of the information and document to the prescribed authority, a penalty of `5 lakh shall be leviable. However, reasonable cause defence against levy of penalty shall be available to the entity. As indicated above, the CbC reporting requirement for a reporting year does not apply unless the consolidated revenues of the preceding year of the group, based on consolidated financial statement, exceeds a threshold to be prescribed. The current international consensus is for a threshold of € 750 million equivalent in local currency. This threshold in Indian currency would be equivalent to `5395 crores (at current rates). Therefore, CbC reporting for an international group having Indian parent, for the previous year 2016-17, shall apply only if the consolidated revenue of the international group in previous year 2015-16 exceeds `5395 crore (the equivalent would be determinable based on exchange rate as on the last day of previous year 2015-16). The amendments will be effective from 1st April, 2017 and shall apply for the Assessment year 2017-18 and subsequent assessment years. Rationalisation of penalty provisions Under the existing provisions, penalty on account of concealment of particulars of income or furnishing inaccurate particulars of income is leviable under section 271(1)(c) of the Income-tax Act. In order to rationalize and bring objectivity, certainty and clarity in the penalty provisions, it is proposed that section 271 shall not apply to and in relation to any assessment for the assessment year commencing on or after the 1stday of April, 2017 and subsequent assessment years and penalty be levied under the newly inserted section 270A with effect from 1st April, 2017. The new section 270A provides for levy of penalty in cases of under reporting and misreporting of income. Sub-section (1) of the proposed new section 270A seeks to provide that the Assessing Officer, Commissioner (Appeals) or the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may levy penalty if a person has under reported his income. It is proposed that a person shall be considered to have under reported his income if,- (a)  the income assessed is greater than the income determined in the return processed under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 143;"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 398 (b)  the income assessed is greater than the maximum amount not chargeable to tax, where no return of income has been furnished; (c)  the income reassessed is greater than the income assessed or reassessed immediately before such re-assessment; (d)  the amount of deemed total income assessed or reassessed as per the provisions of section 115JB or 115JC, as the case may be, is greater than the deemed total income determined in the return processed under clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 143; (e)  the amount of deemed total income assessed as per the provisions of section 115JB or 115JC is greater than the maximum amount not chargeable to tax, where no return of income has been filed; (f)  the income assessed or reassessed has the effect of reducing the loss or converting such loss into income. The amount of under-reported income is proposed to be calculated in different scenarios as discussed herein. In a case where return is furnished and assessment is made for the first time the amount of under reported income in case of all persons shall be the difference between the assessed income and the income determined under section 143(1)(a). In a case where no return has been furnished and the return is furnished for the first time, the amount of under-reported income is proposed to be: (i)  for a company, firm or local authority, the assessed income; (ii)  for a person other than company, firm or local authority, the difference between the assessed income and the maximum amount not chargeable to tax. In case of any person, where income is not assessed for the first time, the amount of under reported income shall be the difference between the income assessed or determined in such order and the income assessed or determined in the order immediately preceding such order. It is further proposed that in a case where under reported income arises out of determination of deemed total income in accordance with the provisions of section 115JB or section 115JC, the amount of total under reported income shall be determined in accordance with the following formula- (A - B) + (C - D) where,  A = the total income assessed as per the provisions other than the"
"Annexure III 399 provisions contained in section 115JB or section 115JC (herein called general provisions);  B = the total income that would have been chargeable had the total income assessed as per the general provisions been reduced by the amount of under reported income;  C = the total income assessed as per the provisions contained in section 115JB or section 115JC;  D = the total income that would have been chargeable had the total income assessed as per the provisions contained in section 115JB or section 115JC been reduced by the amount of under reported income. However, where the amount of under reported income on any issue is considered both under the provisions contained in section 115JB or section 115JC and under general provisions, such amount shall not be reduced from total income assessed while determining the amount under item D. It is clarified that in a case where an assessment or reassessment has the effect of reducing the loss declared in the return or converting that loss into income, the amount of under reported income shall be the difference between the loss claimed and the income or loss, as the case may be, assessed or reassessed. Calculation of under-reported income in a case where the source of any receipt, deposit or investment is linked to earlier year is proposed to be provided based on the existing Explanation 2 to sub-section (l) of section 271 (1). It is also proposed that the under-reported income under this section shall not include the following cases: (i)  where the assessee offers an explanation and the income-tax authority is satisfied that the explanation is bona fide and all the material facts have been disclosed; (ii)  where such under-reported income is determined on the basis of an estimate, if the accounts are correct and complete but the method employed is such that the income cannot properly be deducted therefrom; (iii)  where the assessee has, on his own, estimated a lower amount of addition or disallowance on the issue and has included such amount in the computation of his income and disclosed all the facts material to the addition or disallowance;"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 400 (iv)  where the assessee had maintained information and documents as prescribed under section 92D, declared the international transaction under Chapter X and disclosed all the material facts relating to the transaction; (v)  where the undisclosed income is on account of a search operation and penalty is leviable under section 271AAB. It is proposed that the rate of penalty shall be fifty per cent of the tax payable on under-reported income. However in a case where under reporting of income results from misreporting of income by the assessee, the person shall be liable for penalty at the rate of two hundred per cent of the tax payable on such misreported income. The cases of misreporting of income have been specified as under: (i)  misrepresentation or suppression of facts; (ii)  non-recording of investments in books of account; (iii)  claiming of expenditure not substantiated by evidence; (iv)  recording of false entry in books of account; (v)  failure to record any receipt in books of account having a bearing on total income; (vi)  failure to report any international transaction or deemed international transaction under Chapter X. It is also proposed that in case of company, firm or local authority, the tax payable on under reported income shall be calculated as if the under-reported income is the total income. In any other case the tax payable shall be thirty per cent of the under-reported income. It is also proposed that no addition or disallowance of an amount shall form the basis for imposition of penalty, if such addition or disallowance has formed the basis of imposition of penalty in the case of the person for the same or any other assessment year. These amendments will take effect from 1st day of April, 2017 and will, accordingly apply in relation to assessment year 2017-2018 and subsequent years. Consequential amendments have been proposed in sections 119, 253, 271A, 271AA, 271AAB, 273A and 279 to provide reference to newly inserted section 270A."
"Annexure III 401 The provisions of section 270A are illustrated through examples as below: Example 1. Case is of a firm liable to tax at the rate of 30 per cent. :  (Figures in ` lakh) Returned total Income  Total Income determined under section 143(1)(a)  Total Income assessed under section 143(3)  Total Income reassessed under section 147 180 100 110 150 180 Considering that none of the additions or disallowances made in assessment or reassessment as above qualifies under sub-section (6) of section 270A, the penalty would be calculated as under: Under-reported Income  Tax Payable on under-reported Income  Penalty Leviable* (150-110) = 40  30 % of 40 = 12  50 % of 12 = 6  (180-150) = 30 30 % of 30 = 9  50 % of 9 = 4.5 * Considering under-reported income is not on account of misreporting Example 2.

"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 402 Considering that none of the additions or disallowances made in assessment or reassessment as above qualifies under sub-section (6) of section 270A, the penalty would be calculated as under:  Assessment under section 143 (3) Re-assessment under section 147 Under-reported Income Tax Payable on under-reported Income Penalty Leviable* (-)40 minus (-)90 = 50 30 % of 50 = 15  50 % of 15 = 7.5 20 minus (-)40 = 60 30 % of 60 = 18  50 % of 18 = 9 * Considering under-reported income is not on account of misreporting Extension of time limit to Transfer Pricing Officer in certain cases As per the existing provisions, the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) has to pass his order sixty days prior to the date on which the limitation for making assessment expires. It is noted that at times seeking information from foreign jurisdictions becomes necessary for determination of arm's length price by the TPO and at times proceedings before the TPO may also be stayed by a court order. It is proposed to amend sub-section (3A) of section 92CA to provide that where assessment proceedings are stayed by any court or where a reference for exchange of information has been made by the competent authority, the time available to the Transfer Pricing Officer for making an order after excluding the time for which assessment proceedings were stayed or the time taken for receipt of information, as the case may be, is less than sixty days, then such remaining period shall be extended to sixty days. The amendment will take effect from 1st day of June, 2016. Immunity from penalty and prosecution in certain cases by inserting new section 270AA It is proposed to provide that an assessee may make an application to the Assessing Officer for grant of immunity from imposition of penalty under section 270A and initiation of proceedings under section 276C, provided he pays the tax and interest payable as per the order of assessment or reassessment within the period specified in such notice of demand and does not prefer an appeal against such assessment order. The assessee can make such application within one month from the end of the month in which the order of assessment or reassessment is received in the form and manner, as may be prescribed."
"Annexure III 403 It is proposed that the Assessing Officer shall, on fulfilment of the above conditions and after the expiry of period of filing appeal as specified in sub-section (2) of section 249, grant immunity from initiation of penalty and proceeding under section 276C if the penalty proceedings under section 270A has not been initiated on account of the following, namely:— (a)  misrepresentation or suppression of facts; (b)  failure to record investments in the books of account; (c)  claim of expenditure not substantiated by any evidence; (d)  recording of any false entry in the books of account; (e)  failure to record any receipt in books of account having a bearing on total income; or (f)  failure to report any international transaction or any transaction deemed to be an international transaction or any specified domestic transaction to which the provisions of Chapter X apply. It is proposed that the Assessing Officer shall pass an order accepting or rejecting such application within a period of one month from the end of the month in which such application is received. However, in the interest of natural justice, no order rejecting the application shall be passed by the Assessing Officer unless the assessee has been given an opportunity of being heard. It is proposed that order of Assessing Officer under the said section shall be final. It is proposed that no appeal under section 246A or an application for revision under section 264 shall be admissible against the order of assessment or reassessment referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1), in a case where an order under section 270AA has been made accepting the application. Clause (b) of sub-section (2) of section 249 provides that an appeal before the Commissioner (Appeals) is to be made within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of demand relating to an assessment order. It is proposed to provide that in a case where the assessee makes an application under section 270AA of the Income-tax Act seeking immunity from penalty and prosecution, then, the period beginning from the date on which such application is made to the date on which the order rejecting the application is served on the assessee shall be excluded for calculation of the aforesaid thirty days period. The proposed amendment is consequential to the insertion of section 270AA."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 404 These amendments will take effect from the 1st day of April, 2017 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2017 -2018 and subsequent years. 11. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2017 Scope of section 92BA of the Income-tax Act relating to Specified Domestic Transactions The existing provisions of section 92BA of the Act, inter-alia provide that any expenditure in respect of which payment has been made by the assessee to certain ""specified persons"" under section 40A(2)(b) are covered within the ambit of specified domestic transactions. As a matter of compliance and reporting, taxpayers need to obtain the chartered accountant's certificate in Form 3CEB providing the details such as list of related parties, nature and value of specified domestic transactions (SDTs), method used to determine the arm's length price for SDTs, positions taken with regard to certain transactions not considered as SDTs, etc. This has considerably increased the compliance burden of the taxpayers. In order to reduce the compliance burden of taxpayers, it is proposed to provide that expenditure in respect of which payment has been made by the assessee to a person referred to in under section 40A(2)(b) are to be excluded from the scope of section 92BA of the Act. Accordingly, it is also proposed to make a consequential amendment in section 40(A)(2)(b) of the Act. These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2017 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2017- 18 and subsequent years. Secondary adjustments in certain cases ""Secondary adjustment"" means an adjustment in the books of accounts of the assessee and its associated enterprise to reflect that the actual allocation of profits between the assessee and its associated enterprise are consistent with the transfer price determined as a result of primary adjustment, thereby removing the imbalance between cash account and actual profit of the assessee. As per the OECD's Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (OECD transfer pricing guidelines), secondary adjustment may take the form of constructive dividends, constructive equity contributions, or constructive loans. The provisions of secondary adjustment are internationally recognised and are already part of the transfer pricing rules of many leading economies in"
"Annexure III 405 the world. Whilst the approaches to secondary adjustments by individual countries vary, they represent an internationally recognised method to align the economic benefit of the transaction with the arm's length position. In order to align the transfer pricing provisions in line with OECD transfer pricing guidelines and international best practices, it is proposed to insert a new section 92CE to provide that the assessee shall be required to carry out secondary adjustment where the primary adjustment to transfer price, has been made suo motu by the assessee in his return of income; or made by the Assessing Officer has been accepted by the assessee; or is determined by an advance pricing agreement entered into by the assessee under section 92CC; or is made as per the safe harbour rules framed under section 92CB; or is arising as a result of resolution of an assessment by way of the mutual agreement procedure under an agreement entered into under section 90 or 90A. It is proposed to provide that where as a result of primary adjustment to the transfer price, there is an increase in the total income or reduction in the loss, as the case may be, of the assessee, the excess money which is available with its associated enterprise, if not repatriated to India within the time as may be prescribed, shall be deemed to be an advance made by the assessee to such associated enterprise and the interest on such advance, shall be computed as the income of the assessee, in the manner as may be prescribed. It is also proposed to provide that such secondary adjustment shall not be carried out if, the amount of primary adjustment made in the case of an assessee in any previous year does not exceed one crore rupees and the primary adjustment is made in respect of an assessment year commencing on or before 1st April, 2016. This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2018 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2018-19 and subsequent years. 12. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 2019 Clarification with regard to power of the Assessing Officer in respect of modified return of income filed in pursuance to signing of the Advance Pricing Agreement (APA)  Section 92CC of the Act empowers the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to enter into an APA, with the approval of the Central Government, with any person for determining the Arm’s Length Price (ALP) or specifying"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 406 the manner in which ALP is to be determined in relation to an international transaction which is to be entered into by that person. The APA is valid for a period, not exceeding five previous years, as may be specified therein. This section also provides for rollback of the APA for four years. Thus, once the APA is entered into, the ALP of the international transaction, which is subject matter of the APA, would be determined in accordance with such APA. In order to give effect to the APA, section 92CD also provides for mechanism, including filing of modified return of income by the taxpayer and manner of completion of assessments by the Assessing Officer having regard to terms of the APA. Sub-section (3) of this section deals with a situation where assessment or re-assessment has already been completed, before expiry of the time allowed for filing of modified return. Apprehensions have been expressed stating that due to the use of words “assess or reassess or recompute”, the Assessing Officer may start fresh assessment or reassessment in respect of completed assessments or reassessments of the assessees who have modified their returns of income in accordance with the APA entered into by them, while the intention of the legislature is for Assessing Officer to merely modify the total income consequent to modification of return of income in pursuance to APA. It is, therefore, proposed to amend sub-section (3) of section 92CD to clarify that in cases where assessment or reassessment has already been completed and modified return of income has been filed by the tax payer under sub-section (1) of said section, the Assessing Officers shall pass an order modifying the total income of the relevant assessment year determined in such assessment or reassessment, having regard to and in accordance with the APA. This amendment will take effect from 1st September, 2019. Clarification with regard to provisions of secondary adjustment and giving an option to assessee to make one-time payment  In order to align the transfer pricing provisions with international best practices, section 92CE of the Act provides for secondary adjustments in certain cases. It, inter alia, provides that the assessee shall be required to carry out secondary adjustment where the primary adjustment to transfer price, has been made suo motu, or made by the Assessing Officer and accepted by him; or is determined by an advance pricing agreement entered into by him under section 92CC of the Act; or is made as per safe harbour rules"
"Annexure III 407 prescribed under section 92CB of the Act; or is arising as a result of resolution of an assessment through mutual agreement procedure under an agreement entered into under section 90 or 90A of the Act. The proviso to said sub-section provides exemption in cases where the amount of primary adjustment made in any previous year does not exceed one crore rupees; and the primary adjustment is made in respect of an assessment year commencing on or before 1st April, 2016. Several concerns have been expressed regarding effective implementation of secondary adjustments regime and seeking clarity in law. In order to address such concerns and to make the secondary adjustment regime more effective and easy to comply with, it is proposed to amend section 92CE of the Act so as to provide that:-  (i)  the condition of threshold of one crore rupees and of the primary adjustment made upto assessment year 2016-17 are alternate conditions;  (ii)  the assessee shall be required to calculate interest on the excess money or part thereof;  (iii)  the provision of this section shall apply to the agreements which have been signed on or after 1st April, 2017; however, no refund of the taxes already paid till date under the pre amended section would be allowed;  (iv)  the excess money may be repatriated from any of the associated enterprises of the assessee which is not resident in India;  (v)  in a case where the excess money or part thereof has not been repatriated in time, the assessee will have the option to pay additional income-tax at the rate of eighteen per cent on such excess money or part thereof in addition to the existing requirement of calculation of interest till the date of payment of this additional tax. The additional tax is proposed to be increased by a surcharge of twelve per cent;  (vi)  the tax so paid shall be the final payment of tax and no credit shall be allowed in respect of the amount of tax so paid;  (vii)  the deduction in respect of the amount on which such tax has been paid, shall not be allowed under any other provision of this Act; and"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 408 (viii)  if the assessee pays the additional income-tax, he will not be required to make secondary adjustment or compute interest from the date of payment of such tax. The amendments proposed in para (i) to (iv) above will take effect retrospectively from the 1st April, 2018 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2018-19 and subsequent assessment years. Further, the amendments proposed in para (v) to (viii) will be effective from 1st September, 2019. Rationalisations of provisions relating to maintenance, keeping and furnishing of information and documents by certain persons  Section 92D of the Act inter alia, provides for maintenance and keeping of information and document by persons entering into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction in the prescribed manner. Sub-section (1) of section 92D provides that every person who has entered into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction shall keep and maintain the prescribed information and document in respect thereof. Proviso to said section inserted through the Finance Act, 2016 provides that the person, being a constituent entity of an international group, shall also keep and maintain such information and document in respect of an international group as may be prescribed. Accordingly, Rule 10DA, prescribed for this purpose, provides the requisite information to be furnished in prescribed form, subject to the thresholds of the consolidated group revenue and the international transaction. It is proposed to substitute section 92D of the Act, in order to provide that the information and document to be kept and maintained by a constituent entity of an international group, and filing of required form, shall be applicable even when there is no international transaction undertaken by such constituent entity. It is also proposed to provide that information shall be furnished by the constituent entity of an international group to the prescribed authority. This amendment will take effect from the 1st April, 2020 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2020-21 and subsequent assessment years. 13. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2020 Amendment for providing attribution of profit to Permanent Establishment in"
"Annexure III 409 Safe Harbour Rules under section 92CB and in Advance Pricing Agreement under section 92CC  Section 92CB of the Act empowers the Central Board of Direct Taxes (Board) for making safe harbour rules (SHR) to which the determination of the arm's length price (ALP) under section 92C or section 92CA of the Act shall be subject to. As per Explanation to said section the term “safe harbour” means circumstances in which the Income-tax Authority shall accept the transfer price declared by the assessee. This section was inserted in the Act to reduce the number of transfer pricing audits and prolonged disputes especially in case of relatively smaller assessees. Besides reduction of disputes, the SHR provides certainty as well. Further, section 92CC of the Act empowers the Board to enter into an advance pricing agreement (APA) with any person, determining the ALP or specifying the manner in which the ALP is to be determined, in relation to an international transaction to be entered into by that person. APA provides tax certainty in determination of ALP for five future years as well as for four earlier years (Rollback). SHR provides tax certainty for relatively smaller cases for future years on general terms, while APA provides tax certainty on case to case basis not only for future years but also Rollback years. Both SHR and the APA have been successful in reducing litigation in determination of the ALP. It has been represented that the attribution of profits to the PE of a non-resident under clause (i) of sub-section (1) of section 9 of the Act in accordance with rule 10 of the Rules also results in avoidable disputes in a number of cases. In order to provide certainty, the attribution of income in case of a non-resident person to the PE is also required to be clearly covered under the provisions of the SHR and the APA. In view of the above, it is proposed to amend section 92CB and section 92CC of the Act to cover determination of attribution to PE within the scope of SHR and APA. With respect to section 92CB, the amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2020 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2020-21 and subsequent assessment years. 17 With respect to section 92CC, the amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2020 and therefore will apply to an APA entered into on or after 1st April, 2020."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 410 Excluding interest paid or payable to Permanent Establishment of a non-resident Bank for the purpose of disallowance of interest under section 94B. Section 94B of the Act, inter alia, provides that deductible interest or similar expenses exceeding one crore rupees of an Indian company, or a permanent establishment (PE) of a foreign company, paid to the associated enterprises (AE) shall be restricted to 30 per cent. of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) or interest paid or payable to AE, whichever is less. Further, a loan is deemed to be from an AE, if an AE provides implicit or explicit guarantee in respect of that loan. AE for the purposes of this section has the meaning assigned to it in section 92A of the Act. This section was inserted in the Act through the Finance Act, 2017 in order to implement the measures recommended in final report on Action Plan 4 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project under the aegis of G-20-Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries to address the issue of base erosion and profit shifting by way of excess interest deductions. Representations have been received to carve out interest paid or payable in respect of debt issued by a PE of a non-resident in India, being a person engaged in the business of banking for the reason that as per the existing provisions a branch of the foreign company in India is a non-resident in India. Further, the definition of the AE in section 92A, inter alia, deems two enterprises to be AE, if during the previous year a loan advanced by one enterprise to the other enterprise is at 50 per cent. or more of the book value of the total assets of the other enterprise. Thus, the interest paid or payable in respect of loan from the branch of a foreign bank may attract provisions of interest limitation provided for under this section. It is, therefore, proposed to amend section 94B of the Act so as to provide that provisions of interest limitation would not apply to interest paid in respect of a debt issued by a lender which is a PE of a non-resident, being a person engaged in the business of banking, in India. This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2021 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2021-22 and subsequent assessment years. 14. Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill, 2022 Faceless Schemes under the Act  1. The Central Government has undertaken a number of measures to"
"Annexure III 411 make the processes under the Act, electronic, by eliminating person to person interface between the taxpayer and the Department to the extent technologically feasible, and provide for optimal utilisation of resources and a team-based assessment with dynamic jurisdiction. A series of futuristic reforms have been introduced in the domain of Direct Tax administration for the benefit of taxpayers and economy. This started with faceless assessment in electronic mode involving no human interface between taxpayers and tax officials. The faceless procedures are being introduced in a phased manner in the Act. 2. As part of this process of making the tax administration transparent and efficient, provisions for notifying faceless schemes under sections 92CA, 144C, 253 and 264A were introduced in the Act through Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Act, 2020 with effect from 01.11.2020 and under section 255, was inserted through Finance Act, 2021 with effect from 01.04.2021: S.No. Section Scheme Date of Limitation  92CA Faceless determination of arm’s length price 31st day of March, 2022 2. 144C Faceless Dispute Resolution Panel 31st day of March, 2022 3. 253 Faceless appeal to Appellate Tribunal 31st day of March, 2022 4. 255 Faceless procedure of Appellate Tribunal 31st day of March, 20 S.No. Section Scheme Date of Limitation  1. 92CA Faceless determination of arm’s length price 31st day of March, 2022 2. 144C Faceless Dispute Resolution Panel 31st day of March, 2022 3. 253 Faceless appeal to Appellate Tribunal 31st day of March, 2022 4. 255 Faceless procedure of Appellate Tribunal 31st day of March, 2023 3. Section 92CA and section 144C are principally related to the transfer pricing functions and international taxation which are presently out of the regime of faceless assessment. New schemes for these two functions are a part of the assessment function and should follow the faceless assessment procedure, wherein certain modifications are proposed which will have an impact on the information technology structure. Therefore, notification at this time shall result in delay in stabilization of the systems."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 412 4. As for notification of scheme under section 255, the Appellate Tribunal is deemed to be a civil court for all the purposes of section 195 of the Act and Chapter XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. Therefore, a scheme governing the procedures to be followed by such a body needs to be formulated after due consultations with Ministry of Law & Justice. Similarly, the scheme under section 253 have to follow the scheme under section 255. 5. In light of the above limitations it is proposed to extend the date for issuing directions for the purposes of these sections 92CA, 144C, 253 and 255 till 31st March, 2024. 6. These amendments will take effect from 1 st April, 2022. Amendment in the provisions of section 263 of the Act  1. Section 263 of the Act contains the provision for revision of order which is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of revenue. An order under section 263 of the Act can be passed within two years from the end of the financial year in which the order sought to be revised was passed. 2. As per provisions of section 92CA, if the Assessing Officer considers it necessary or expedient, he may, with the approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner refer the computation of arm’s length price (ALP or specified domestic transaction entered into by an assessee, to the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO). The TPO passes an order determining the ALP in an international transaction or specified domestic transaction under the provisions of section 92CA and send it to the Assessing Officer for final income determination. However, it is not clear as to who has the power under section 263 to revise the order of the TPO passed under section 92CA. 3. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the provisions of section 263 of the Act so as to provide that the Principal Chief Commissioner or the Chief Commissioner or the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner who is assigned the jurisdiction of transfer pricing may call for and examine the record of any proceeding under this Act, and if he considers that any order passed by the TPO, working under his jurisdiction, to be erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of revenue, he may pass an order directing revision of the order of TPO. Consequential changes are also be made in the provisions of section 153 of the Act inter alia to provide two months’ time to the Assessing Officer to give effect to the order of TPO consequent to the directions in the revision order."
"Annexure III 413 4. Further, in section 153 of the Act, it is proposed to  (i)  provide that the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (5) of that section shall also be applicable to order passed by Transfer Pricing Officer under section 92CA,  (ii)  to insert sub-section (5A) to provide that where the Transfer Pricing Officer gives effect to an order or direction under section 263 by means of an order under section 92CA and forwards such order to the Assessing Officer, the 106 Assessing Officer shall proceed to modify the order of assessment or reassessment or recomputation, in conformity with such order of the Transfer Pricing Officer, within two months from the end of the month in which such order of the Transfer Pricing Officer is received by him,  (iii)  provide that the said provisions of the sub-section (6) shall also be applicable to orders referred to in the sub-section (5A) inserted in the Act. 5. These amendments will take effect from 1 st of April, 2022."
"     Annexure IV Circulars 1. Circular No.12 of 2001 dated 23rd August, 2001 To All the Chief Commissioners/ Director-General of Income-tax Subject: Provisions governing transfer price in an international transaction - regarding. The Finance Act, 2001, has substituted the existing section 92 of the Income-tax Act by new sections 92 and 92A to 92F. These new provisions lay down that income arising from an international transaction between associated enterprises shall be computed having regard to the arm’s length price. The term “associated enterprise” has been defined in section 92A. Section 92B defines an “international transaction” between two or more associated enterprises. The provisions contained in section 92C provide for methods to determine the arm’s length price in relation to an international transaction, and the most appropriate method to be followed out of the specified methods. While the primary responsibility of determining and applying an arm’s length price is on the assessee, sub-section (3) of section 92C empowers the Assessing Officer to determine the arm’s length price and compute the total income of the assessee accordingly, subject to the conditions provided therein. Section 92D provides for certain information and documents required to be maintained by persons entering into international transactions, and section 92E provides for a report of an accountant to be furnished along with the return of income. The Board have prescribed rules 10A to 10E in the Income-tax Rules, 1962, giving the manner and the circumstances in which different methods would be applied in determining arm’s length price and the factors governing the selection of the most appropriate method. The form of the report of the accountant and the documents and information required to be maintained by the assessees have also been prescribed. The aforesaid provisions have been enacted with a view to provide a statutory framework which can lead to computation of reasonable, fair and equitable profit and tax in India so that the profits chargeable to tax in India"
"Annexure IV 415 do not get diverted elsewhere by altering the prices charged and paid in intra-group transactions leading to erosion of our tax revenues. However, this is a new legislation. In the initial years of its implementation, there may be room for different interpretations leading to uncertainties with regard to determination of arm’s length price of an international transaction. While it would be necessary to protect our tax base, there is a need to ensure that the taxpayers are not put to avoidable hardship in the implementation of these regulations. In this background the Board have decided the following: (i) The Assessing Officer shall not make any adjustment to the arm’s length price determined by the taxpayer, if such price is up to 5 per cent less or up to 5 per cent more than the price determined by the Assessing Officer. In such cases the price declared by the taxpayer may be accepted. (ii) The provisions of sections 92 and 92A to 92F come into force with effect from 1st April, 2002, and are accordingly applicable to the assessment year 2002-03 and subsequent years. The law requires the associated enterprises to maintain such documents and information relating to international transactions as may be prescribed. However, the necessary rules could be framed by the Board only after the Finance Bill received the assent of the President and have just been notified. Therefore, where an assessee has failed to maintain the prescribed information or documents in respect of transactions entered into during the period 1.4.2001 to 31.8.2001 the provisions of section 92C(3) should not be invoked for such failure. Penalty proceedings under section 271AA or 271G should also not be initiated for such default. (iii) It should be made clear to the concerned Assessing Officers that where an international transaction has been put to a scrutiny, the Assessing Officer can have recourse to sub-section (3) of section 92C only under the circumstances enumerated in clauses (a) to (d) of that sub-section and in the vent of material information or documents in his possession on the basis of which an opinion can be formed that any such circumstance exists. In all other cases, the value of the international transaction should be accepted without further scrutiny."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 416 This may be brought to the notice of all the officers working in your region. Yours faithfully (Sd.) Batsala Jha Yadav Under Secretary (TPL-IV) F.No.142/41/2001-TPL] 2. Extracts from Explanatory Circular No.14 on provisions relating to Finance Act, 2001 “New Legislation to curb tax avoidance by abuse of transfer pricing 55.1 The increasing participation of multi-national groups in economic activities in the country has given rise to new and complex issues emerging from transactions entered into between two or more enterprises belonging to the same multi-national group. The profits derived by such enterprises carrying on business in India can be controlled by the multi-national group, by manipulating the prices charged and paid in such intra-group transactions, thereby, leading to erosion of tax revenues. 55.2 Under the existing section 92 of the Income-tax Act, which was the only section dealing specifically with cross border transactions, an adjustment could be made to the profits of a resident arising from a business carried on between the resident and a non-resident, if it appeared to the Assessing Officer that owing to the close connection between them, the course of business was so arranged so as to produce less than expected profits to the resident. Rule 11 prescribed under the section provided a method of estimation of reasonable profits in such cases. However, this provision was of a general nature and limited in scope. It did not allow adjustment of income in the case of non-residents. It referred to a “close connection” which was undefined and vague. It provided for adjustment of profits rather than adjustment of prices, and the rule prescribed for estimating profits was not scientific. It also did not apply to individual transactions such as payment of royalty, etc., which are not part of a regular business carried on between a resident and a non-resident. There were also no detailed rules prescribing the documentation required to be maintained. 55.3 With a view to provide a detailed statutory framework which can lead to computation of reasonable, fair and equitable profits and tax in India, in the case of such multi-national enterprises, the Act has substituted section 92 with a new section, and has introduced new section 92A to 92F in the Income-tax Act, relating to computation of income from an international"
"Annexure IV 417 transaction having regard to the arm’s length price, meaning of associated enterprise, meaning of international transaction, computation of arm’s length price, maintenance of information and documents by persons entering into international transactions, furnishing of a report from an accountant by persons entering into international transactions and definitions of certain expressions occurring in the said sections. 55.4 The newly substituted section 92 provides that income arising from an international transaction between associated enterprises shall be computed having regard to the arm’s length price. Any expense or outgoing in an international transaction is also to be computed having regard to the arm’s length price. Thus in the case of a manufacturer, for example, the provisions will apply to exports made to the associated enterprise as also to imports from the same or any other associated enterprise. The provision is also applicable in a case where the international transaction comprises only an outgoing from the Indian assessee. 55.5  The new section further provides that the cost or expenses allocated or apportioned between two or more associated enterprises under a mutual agreement or arrangement shall be at arm’s length price. Examples of such transactions could be where one associated enterprise carries out centralized functions which also benefit one or more other associated enterprises, or two or more associated enterprises agree to carry out a joint activity, such as research and development, for their mutual benefit. 55.6 The new provision is intended to ensure that profits taxable in India are not understated (or losses are not overstated) by declaring lower receipts or higher outgoings than those which would have been declared by persons entering into similar transactions with unrelated parties in the same or similar circumstances. The basic intention underlying the new transfer pricing regulations is to prevent shifting out of profits by manipulating prices charges or paid in international transactions, thereby eroding the country’s tax base. The new section 92 is, therefore, not intended to be applied in cases where the adoption of the arm’s length price determined under the regulations would result in a decrease in the overall tax incidence in India in respect of the parties involved in the international transaction. 55.7 The substituted new sections 92A and 92B provide meanings of the expressions “associated enterprise” and “international transaction” with reference to which the income is to be computed under the new section 92. While sub-section (1) of section 92A gives a general definition of associated enterprises, based on the concept of participation in management, control or"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 418 capital, sub-section (2) specifies the circumstances under which the two enterprises shall be deemed to be associated enterprises. 55.8 Section 92B provides a broad definition of an international transaction, which is to be read with the definition of transaction given in section 92F. An international transaction is essentially a cross border transaction between associated enterprises in any sort of property, whether tangible or intangible, or in the provision of services, lending of money etc. At least one of the parties to the transaction must be a non-resident. The definition also covers a transaction between two non-residents, where the example, one of them has a permanent establishment whose income is taxable in India. 55.9 Sub-section (2) of section 92B extends the scope of the definition of international transaction by providing that a transaction entered into with an unrelated person shall be deemed to be a transaction with an associated enterprise, if there exists a prior agreement in relation to the transaction between such other person and the associated enterprise, or the terms of the relevant transaction are determined by the associated enterprise. An illustration of such a transaction could be where the assessee, being an enterprise resident in India, exports goods to an unrelated person abroad, and there is a separate arrangement or agreement between the unrelated person and an associated enterprise which influences the price at which the goods are exported. In such a case the transaction with the unrelated enterprise will also be subject to transfer pricing regulations. 55.10 The new section 92C provides that the arm’s length price in relation to an international transaction shall be determined by (a) comparable uncontrolled price method; or (b) resale price method; or (c) cost plus method; or (d) profits split method; or (e) transactional net margin method; or (f) any other method which may be prescribed by the Board. For the present, no additional method has been prescribed. One of the five specified methods shall be the most appropriate method in respect of a particular international transaction, and shall be applied for computation of arm’s length price in the manner specified by the rules. Rules 10A to 10E, which have been separately notified vide S.O. 808(E), dated 21.8.2001 inter alia, provide for the factors which are to be considered in selecting the most appropriate method. The major considerations in this regard have been specified to be the availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for application of the method, the extent and reliability of assumptions required to be made and the degree of comparability existing between the international transaction and the uncontrolled transaction. The rules also lay down in"
"Annexure IV 419 detail the manner in which the methods are to be applied in determining the arm’s length price. 55.11 Applying the most appropriate method to different sets of comparable data can possibly result in computation of more than one arm’s length price. With a view to avoid unnecessary disputes, the proviso to section 92C(2) provides that in such a case the arithmetic mean of the prices shall be adopted as the arm’s length price. In normal course, if the different sets of comparable data are equally reliable there may not be any significant divergence between the various arm’s length prices determined. 55.12 Under the new provisions the primary onus is on the tax payer to determine an arm’s length price in accordance with the rules, and to substantiate the same with the prescribed documentation. Where such onus is discharged by the assessee and the data used for determining the arm’s length price is reliable and correct, there can be no intervention by the Assessing Officer. This is made clear by sub-section (3) of section 92C which provides that the Assessing Officer may intervene only if he is, on the basis of material or information or document in his possession, of the opinion that the price charged in the international transaction has not been determined in accordance with sub-sections (1) and (2), or information and documents relating to the international transaction have not been kept and maintained by the assessee in accordance with the provisions contained in sub-section (1) of section 92D and the rules made thereunder; or the information or data used in computation of the arm’s length price is not reliable or correct; or the assessee has failed to furnish, within the specified time, any information or document which he was required to furnish by a notice issued under sub-section (3) of section 92D. If any one of such circumstances exists, the Assessing Officer may reject the price adopted by the assessee and determine the arm’s length price in accordance with the same rules. However, an opportunity has to be given to the assessee before determining such price. Thereafter, as provided in sub-section (4) of section 92C, the Assessing Officer may compute the total income on the basis of the arm’s length price so determined by him. 55.13 The first proviso to section 92C(4) recognizes the commercial reality that even when a transfer pricing adjustment is made under that sub-section, the amount represented by the adjustment would not actually have been received in India or would have actually gone out of the country. Therefore it has been provided that no deductions under section 10A or 10B or under Chapter VI-A shall be allowed in respect of the amount of adjustment."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 420 55.14 The second proviso to section 92C(4) refers to a case where the amount involved in the international transaction has already been remitted abroad after deducting tax at source and subsequently, in the assessment of the resident payer, an adjustment is made to the transfer price involved and, thereby, the expenditure represented by the amount so remitted is partly disallowed. Under the Income-tax Act, a non-resident in receipt of income from which tax has been deducted at source has the option of filing a return of income in respect of the relevant income. In such cases, a non-resident could claim a refund of a part of the tax deducted at source, on the ground that an arm’s length price has been adopted by the Assessing Officer in the case of the resident and the same price should be considered in determining the taxable income of the non-resident. However, the adoption of the arm’s length price in such cases would not alter the commercial reality that the entire amount claimed earlier would have actually been received by the entity located abroad. It has therefore been made clear in the second proviso that income of one associated enterprise shall not be recomputed merely by reason of an adjustment made in the case of the other associated enterprise on determination of arm’s length price by the Assessing Officer. 55.15 The new section 92D provides that every person who has undertaken an international transaction shall keep and maintain such information and documents as may be specified by rules made by the Board. The Board may also specify by rules the period for which the information and documents are required to be retained. The documentation required to be maintained has been prescribed under rule 10D. Such documentation includes background information on the commercial environment in which the transaction has been entered into, and information regarding the international transaction entered into, the analysis carried out to select the most appropriate method and to identify comparable transactions, and the actual working out of the arm’s length price of the transaction. The documentation should be available with the assessee by the specified date defined in section 92F and should be retained for a period of 8 years. During the course of any proceedings under the Act, an Assessing Officer or Commissioner (Appeals) may require any person who has undertaken an international transaction to furnish any of the information and documents specified under the rules with a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of a notice issued in this regard, and such period may be extended by a further period not exceeding thirty days. 55.16 The new section 92E provides that every person who has entered into an international transaction during a previous year shall obtain a report from accountant and furnish such report on or before the specified date in the"
"Annexure IV 421 prescribed form and manner. Rule 10E and Form No.3CEB have been notified in this regard. The accountants’ report only requires furnishing of factual information relating to the international transaction entered into, the arm’s length price determined by the assessee and the method applied in such determination. It also requires an opinion as to whether the prescribed documentation has been maintained. 55.17 The new section 92F defines the expression “accountant”, “arm’s length price”, “enterprise”, “specified date” and “transaction” used in sections 92, 92A, 92B, 92C, 92D and 92E. The definition of enterprise is broad and includes a permanent establishment, even though a PE is not a separate legal entity. Consequently, transactions between a foreign enterprise and its PE, for example, between the head office abroad and a branch in India, are also subject to these transfer pricing regulations. Also the regulation 33 would apply to transactions between a foreign enterprise and a PE of another foreign enterprise. The term permanent establishment has not been defined in the provisions but its meaning may be understood with reference to the tax treaties entered into by India. 55.18 With a view to ensure that multinational enterprises comply with the requirements of the new regulations, the Act has also amended section 271 and inserted new sections 271AA, 271BA and 271G in the Income-tax Act, so as to provide for penalty to be levied in cases of non-compliance with procedural requirements, and in cases of understatement of profits through fraud or willful negligence. 55.19 The new Explanation 7 to sub-section (1) of section 271 provides that where in the case of an assessee who has entered into an international transaction, any amount is added or disallowed in computing the total income under sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 92, then, the amount so added or disallowed shall be deemed to represent income in respect of which particulars have been concealed or inaccurate particulars have been furnished. However, no penalty under section 271(1)(c) shall be levied where the assessee proves to the satisfaction of the Assessing Officer or the Commissioner (Appeals) that the price charged or paid in such transaction has been determined in accordance with section 92C in good faith and with due diligence. 55.20 The new section 271AA provides that if any person who has entered into an international transaction fails to keep and maintain any such information and documents as specified under section 92D, the Assessing Officer or Commissioner (Appeals) may direct that such person shall pay, by"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 422 way of penalty, a sum equal to two per cent of the value of the international transaction entered into by such person. 55.21 The new section 271BA provides that if any person fails to furnish a report from an accountant as required by section 92E, the Assessing Officer may direct that such person shall pay by way of penalty, a sum of one lakh rupees. 55.22 The new section 271G provides that if any person who has entered into an international transaction fails to furnish any information or documents as required under sub-section (3) of section 92D, the Assessing Officer or the Commissioner (Appeals) may direct that such person shall pay, by way of penalty, a sum equal to two per cent of the value of the international transaction. 55.23 The Act has also amended section 273B to provide that the above mentioned penalties under sections 271AA, 271BA and 271G shall not be imposable if the assessee proves that there was reasonable cause for such failures. 55.24 These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2002 and will accordingly apply to the assessment year 2002-2003 and subsequent years.” [Circular No.14/2001]  F.No.142/13/2010-SO (TPL) Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue Central Board of Direct Taxes New Delhi, the 30th September, 2010 CORRIGENDUM No.__________(F.No.142/13/2010-SO(TPL).

SECTION 92C OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961, READ WITH RULE 10B OF THE INCOME-TAX RULES, 1962 - TRANSFER PRICING - COMPUTATION OF ARM'S LENGTH PRICE - APPLICATION OF PROFIT SPLIT METHOD CIRCULAR NO. 2/2013 [F. NO. 500/139/2012], DATED 26-3-2013 [WITHDRAWN BY CIRCULAR NO. 5/2013 [F. NO.500/139/2012-FTD-I], DATED 29-6-2013] It has been brought to the notice of CBDT that clarification is needed for selection of profit split method (PSM) as most appropriate method. The issue has been examined in CBDT. It is hereby clarified that while selecting PSM as the most appropriate method, the following points may be kept in mind: 1. Since there is no correlation between cost incurred on R&D activities and return on an intangible developed through R&D activities, the use of transfer pricing methods [like Transactional Net Margin Method] that seek to estimate the value of intangible based on cost of intangible development (R&D cost) plus a return, is generally discouraged. 2. Rule 10B(1)(d) of Income-tax Rules, 1962 (the Rules) provides that profit split method (PSM) may be applicable mainly in international transactions involving transfer of unique intangibles or in multiple international transactions which are so interrelated that they cannot be evaluated separately for the purpose of determining the arm's length price of any one transaction. The PSM determines appropriate return on intangibles on the basis of relative contributions made by each associated enterprise. 3. Selection and application of PSM will depend upon following factors as prescribed under rule 10C(2) of the Rules :  the nature and class of the international transaction;  the class or classes of associated enterprises entering into the"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 424 transaction and the functions performed by them taking into account assets employed or to be employed and risks assumed by such enterprise;  the availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for application of the method;  the degree of comparability existing between the international transaction and the uncontrolled transaction and between the enterprise entering into such transactions;  the extent to which reliable and accurate adjustments can be made to account for differences, if any, between the international transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transaction or between the enterprise entering into such transactions;  the nature, extent and reliability of assumptions required to be made in application of a method. 4. It is evident from the above that rule 10C(2) of the Rules stipulates availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for the application of the method as one of the several factors in selection of most appropriate method. Accordingly, in a case, where the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) is of view that PSM cannot be applied to determine the arm's length price of international transactions involving intangibles due to non-availability of information and reliable data required for application of the method, he must record reasons for non-applicability of PSM before considering TNMM or comparable uncontrolled price method (CUP) as most appropriate method depending upon facts and circumstances of the case. 5. Application of Profit Split Method requires information mainly about the taxpayer and associated enterprises. Section 92D of the Income-tax Act, 1961 provides for maintenance of relevant information and documents by the taxpayer as prescribed under rule 10D of the Rules. Therefore, there should be good and sufficient reason for non-availability of such information with the taxpayer. 6. Depending upon facts and circumstances of the case, TPO may consider TNMM or CUP method as appropriate method by selecting comparables engaged in development of intangibles in same line of business and make upward adjustments taking into account transfer of intangibles without additional remuneration, location savings and location specific advantages"

SECTION 92C OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961 - TRANSFER PRICING - COMPUTATION OF ARM’S LENGTH PRICE - CLARIFICATIONS ON FUNCTIONAL PROFILE OF DEVELOPMENT CENTRES ENGAGED IN CONTRACT R&D SERVICES WITH INSIGNIFICANT RISK - CONDITIONS RELEVANT TO IDENTIFY SUCH DEVELOPMENT CENTRES  CIRCULAR NO. 3/2013 [F NO. 500/139/2012], DATED 26-3-2013 [SEE ALSO AMENDMENT MADE BY CIRCULAR NO. 6/2013, DATED 29-6-2013] It has been brought to the notice of CBDT that there is divergence of views amongst the field officers and taxpayers regarding the functional profile of development centres engaged in contract R&D services for the purposes of transfer pricing audit. Moreover, while at times taxpayers have been insisting that they are contract R&D service providers with insignificant risk, the TPOs are treating them as full or significant risk-bearing entities and making transfer pricing adjustments accordingly. The issue has been examined in CBDT. It is hereby clarified that a development centre in India may be treated as a contract R&D service provider with insignificant risk if the following conditions are cumulatively complied with : 1 Foreign principal performs most of the economically significant functions involved in research or product development cycle whereas Indian development centre would largely be involved in economically insignificant functions; 2. The principal provides funds/ capital and other economically significant assets including intangibles for research or product development and Indian development centre would not use any other economically significant assets including intangibles in research or product development; 3. Indian development centre works under direct supervision of foreign principal who not only has capability to control or supervise but also actually controls or supervises research or product development through its strategic decisions to perform core functions as well as monitor activities on regular basis; 4. Indian development centre does not assume or has no economically significant realized risks. If a contract shows the principal to be controlling the risk but conduct shows that Indian development centre is doing so, then the contractual terms are not the final determinant of"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 426 actual activities. In the case of foreign principal being located in a country/territory widely perceived as a low or no tax jurisdiction, it will be presumed that the foreign principal is not controlling the risk. However, the Indian development centre may rebut this presumption to the satisfaction of the revenue authorities; and 5. Indian development centre has no ownership right (legal or economic) on outcome of research which vests with foreign principal, and that it shall be evident from conduct of the parties. The satisfaction of all the above mentioned conditions should be borne out by the conduct of the parties and not merely by the contractual terms. The above may be brought to the notice of all concerned. 5. SECTION 92C OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961 - TRANSFER PRICING - COMPUTATION OF ARM'S LENGTH PRICE - CLARIFICATIONS ON FUNCTIONAL PROFILE OF DEVELOPMENT CENTERS ENGAGED IN CONTRACT R&D SERVICES WITH INSIGNIFICANT RISK - CONDITIONS RELEVANT TO IDENTIFY SUCH DEVELOPMENT CENTERS - AMENDMENT OF CIRCULAR NO. 3/2013, DATED 26-3-2013  CIRCULAR NO.06/2013 [F NO. 500/139/2012], DATED 29-6-2013 It has been brought to the notice of CBDT that there is divergence of views amongst the field officers and taxpayers regarding the functional profile of development centres engaged in contract R&D services for the purposes of determining arm's length price/transfer pricing. In some cases, while taxpayers insist that they are contract R&D service providers with insignificant risk, the TPOs treat them as full or significant risk-bearing entities and make transfer pricing adjustments accordingly. The issue has been examined in the CBDT. The Research and Development Centres set up by foreign companies can be classified into three broad categories based on functions, assets and risk assumed by the centre established in India. These are: 1. Centres which are entrepreneurial in nature; 2. Centres which are based on cost-sharing arrangements; and 3. Centres which undertake contract research and development. While the three categories are not water-tight compartments, it is possible to distinguish them based on functions, assets and risk. It will be obvious that"
"Annexure IV 427 in the first case the Development Centre performs significantly important functions and assumes substantial risks. In the third case, it will be obvious that the functions, assets and risk are minimal. The second case falls between the first and the third cases. More often than not, the assessee claims that the Development Centre in India must be treated as a contract R&D service provider with insignificant risk. Consequently, the assessee claims that in such cases the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) must be adopted as the most appropriate method. The CBDT has carefully considered the matter and lays down the following guidelines for identifying the Development Centre as a contract R&D service provider with insignificant risk. 1. Foreign principal performs most of the economically significant functions involved in research or product development cycle either through its own employees or through its associated enterprises while the Indian Development Centre carries out the work assigned to it by the foreign principal. Economically significant functions would include critical functions such as conceptualization and design of the product and providing the strategic direction and framework; 2. The foreign principal or its associated enterprise(s) provides funds/capital and other economically significant assets including intangibles for research or product development. The foreign principal or its associated enterprise(s) also provides a remuneration to the Indian Development Centre for the work carried out by the latter; 3. The Indian Development Centre works under the direct supervision of the foreign principal or its associated enterprise which has not only the capability to control or supervise but also actually controls or supervises research or product development through its strategic decisions to perform core functions as well as monitor activities on regular basis; 4. The Indian Development Centre does not assume or has no economically significant realized risks. If a contract shows that the foreign principal is obligated to control the risk but the conduct shows that the Indian Development Centre is doing so, then the contractual terms are not the final determinant of actual activities; 5. In the case of a foreign principal being located in a country/territory widely perceived as a low or no tax jurisdiction, it will be presumed"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 428 that the foreign principal is not controlling the risk. However, the Indian Development Centre may rebut this presumption to the satisfaction of the revenue authorities. Low tax jurisdiction shall mean any country or territory notified in this behalf under section 94A of the Act or any other country or territory that may be notified for the purpose of Chapter X of the Act; 6. Indian Development Centre has no ownership right (legal or economic) on the outcome of the research which vests with the foreign principal and that this is evident from the contract as well as from the conduct of the parties. The Assessing Officer or the Transfer Pricing Officer, as the case may be, shall have regard to the guidelines above and shall take a decision based on the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case. In doing so, the Assessing Officer or the Transfer Pricing Officer, as the case may be, shall be guided by the conduct of the parties and not merely by the terms of the contract. The Assessing Officer or the Transfer Pricing Officer, as the case may be, shall bear in mind the provisions of section 92C of the Act and Rule 10A to Rule 10C of the Rules. He shall also apply the guidelines enumerated above and select the 'most appropriate method'. The above may be brought to the notice of all concerned. 6. Clarifications on Rollback Provisions of Advance Pricing Agreement Scheme  Circular No. 10/2015 [F.No. 500/7/2015-APA-II] DATED 10-06-2015 The Advance Pricing Agreement provisions were introduced in 2012 through insertion of sections 92CC and 92CD in the Income-tax Act, 1961 by the Finance Act, 2012. Subsequently, the Advance Pricing Agreement Scheme was notified vide S.O. 2005 (E), dated 30/8/2012, thereby inserting Rules 10F to 10T and Rule 44GA in the Income-tax Rules, 1962. 2. Rollback provisions in the APA Scheme were introduced through subsection (9A) inserted in section 92CC by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2014 and the relevant rules, namely, Rules 10MA and 10RA, have been notified recently vide S.O. 758(E) dated 14th March, 2015 and S.O. 915(E) dated 1st April, 2015."
"Subsequent to the notification of the rules, requests for clarification regarding certain issues have been received in the Central Board"
"Annexure IV 429 of Direct Taxes. In order to clarify such issues, the Board has decided to adopt a Question and Answer format and the clarifications are hereby provided as below: Q.1  Under rule 10 MA(2)(ii) there is a condition that the return of income for the relevant roll back year has been or is furnished by the applicant before the due date specified in Explanation 2 to sub-section (1) of section 139 of the Income tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’). It is not clear as to whether applicants who have filed returns under section 139(4) or 139(5) of the Act would be eligible for roll back. Answer: The return of income under section 139(5) of the Act can be filed only when a return under section 139(1) has already been filed. Therefore, the return of income filed under section 139(5) of the Act, replaces the original return of income filed under section 139(1) of the Act. Hence, if there is a return which is filed under section 139(5) of the Act to revise the original return filed before the due date specified in Explanation 2 to sub-section (1) of section 139, the applicant would be entitled for rollback on this revised return of income. However, rollback provisions will not be available in case of a return of income filed under section 139(4) because it is a return which is not filed before the due date. Q.2  Rule 10MA (2)(i) mandates that the rollback provision shall apply in respect of an international transaction that is same as the international transaction to which the agreement (other than the rollback provision) applies. It is not clear what is the meaning of the word “same”. Further, it is not clear whether this restriction also applies to the Functions, Assets, Risks (FAR) analysis. Answer: The international transaction for which a rollback provision is to be allowed should be the same as the one proposed to be undertaken in the future years and in respect of which the agreement has been reached. There cannot be a situation where rollback is finalised for a transaction which is not covered in the agreement for future years. The term same international transaction implies that the transaction in the rollback year has to be of same nature and undertaken with the same associated enterprise(s), as proposed to be undertaken in the future years and in respect of which agreement has been"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 430 reached. In the context of FAR analysis, the restriction would operate to ensure that rollback provisions would apply only if the FAR analysis of the rollback year does not differ materially from the FAR validated for the purpose of reaching an agreement in respect of international transactions to be undertaken in the future years for which the agreement applies. The word “materially” is generally being defined in the Advance Pricing Agreements being entered into by CBDT. According to this definition, the word “materially” will be interpreted consistently with its ordinary definition and in a manner that a material change of facts and circumstances would be understood as a change which could reasonably have resulted in an agreement with significantly different terms and conditions. Q.3  Rule 10MA (2)(iv) requires that the application for rollback provision, in respect of an international transaction, has to be made by the applicant for all the rollback years in which the said international transaction has been undertaken by the applicant. Clarification is required as to whether rollback has to be requested for all four years or applicant can choose the years out of the block of four years. Answer: The applicant does not have the option to choose the years for which it wants to apply for rollback. The applicant has to either apply for all the four years or not apply at all. However, if the covered international transaction(s) did not exist in a rollback year or there is some disqualification in a rollback year, then the applicant can apply for rollback for less than four years. Accordingly, if the covered international transaction(s) were not in existence during any of the rollback years, the applicant can apply for rollback for the remaining years. Similarly, if in any of the rollback years for the covered international transaction(s), the applicant fails the test of the rollback conditions contained in various provisions, then it would be denied the benefit of rollback for that rollback year. However, for other rollback years, it can still apply for rollback. Q.4 Rule 10 MA(3) states that the rollback provision shall not be provided in respect of an international transaction for a rollback year if the determination of arm’s length price of the said international transaction for the said year has been the subject matter of an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal has passed an order disposing of such appeal at any time before signing of the agreement. Further, Rule 10 RA(4) provides that if any appeal filed by the applicant is pending before the Commissioner (Appeals), Appellate Tribunal or the High Court for a rollback"
"Annexure IV 431 year, on the issue which is subject matter of the rollback provision for that year, the said appeal to the extent of the subject covered under the agreement shall be withdrawn by the applicant. There is a need to clarify the phrase “Tribunal has passed an order disposing of such appeal” and on the mismatch, if any, between Rule 10MA(3) and Rule 10RA(4). Answer: The reason for not allowing rollback for the international transaction for which Appellate Tribunal has passed an order disposing of an appeal is that the ITAT is the final fact finding authority and hence, on factual issues, the matter has already reached finality in that year. However, if the ITAT has not decided the matter and has only set aside the order for fresh consideration of the matter by the lower authorities with full discretion at their disposal, the matter shall not be treated as one having reached finality and hence, benefit of rollback can still be given. There is no mismatch between Rule 10MA(3) and Rule 10RA(4). Q.5  Rule 10MA(3)(ii) provides that rollback provision shall not be provided in respect of an international transaction for a rollback year if the application of rollback provision has the effect of reducing the total income or increasing the loss, as the case may be, of the applicant as declared in the return of income of the said year. It may be clarified whether the rollback provisions in such situations can be applied in a manner so as to ensure that the returned income or loss is accepted as the final income or loss after applying the rollback provisions. Answer: It is clarified that in case the terms of rollback provisions contain specific agreement between the Board and the applicant that the agreed determination of ALP or the agreed manner of determination of ALP is subject to the condition that the ALP would get modified to the extent that it does not result in reducing the total income or increasing the total loss, as the case may be, of the applicant as declared in the return of income of the said year, the rollback provisions could be applied. For example, if the declared income is `100, the income as adjusted by the TPO is `120, and the application of the rollback provisions results in reducing the income to `90, then the rollback for that year would be determined in a manner that the declared income `100 would be treated as the final income for that year."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 432 Q.6  Rule 10RA(7) states that in case effect cannot be given to the rollback provision of an agreement in accordance with this rule, for any rollback year to which it applies, on account of failure on the part of applicant, the agreement shall be cancelled. It is to be clarified as to whether the entire agreement is to be cancelled or only that year for which roll back fails. Answer: The procedure for giving effect to a rollback provision is laid down in Rule 10RA. Sub-rules (2), (3), (4) and (6) of the Rule specify the actions to be taken by the applicant in order that effect may be given to the rollback provision. If the applicant does not carry out such actions for any of the rollback years, the entire agreement shall be cancelled. This is because the rollback provision has been introduced for the benefit of the applicant and is applicable at its option. Accordingly, if the rollback provision cannot be given effect to for any of the rollback years on account of the applicant not taking the actions specified in sub-rules (2), (3), (4) or (6), the entire agreement gets vitiated and will have to be cancelled. Q.7  If there is a Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) application already pending for a rollback year, what would be the stand of the APA authorities? Further, what would be the view of the APA Authorities if MAP has already been concluded for a rollback year? Answer: If MAP has been already concluded for any of the international transactions in any of the rollback year under APA, rollback provisions would not be allowed for those international transactions for that year but could be allowed for other years or for other international transactions for that year, subject to fulfilment of specified conditions in Rules 10MA and 10RA. However, if MAP request is pending for any of the rollback year under APA, upon the option exercised by the applicant, either MAP or application for roll back shall be proceeded with for such year. Q.8  Rule 10MA(1) provides that the agreement may provide for determining ALP or manner of determination of ALP. However, Rule 10MA(4) only specifies that the manner of determination of ALP should be the same as in the APA term. Does that mean the ALP could be different? Answer: Yes, the ALP could be different for different years. However, the manner of determination of ALP (including choice of Method, comparability analysis and Tested Party) would be same."
"Annexure IV 433 Q.9  Will there be compliance audit for roll back? Would critical assumptions have to be validated during compliance audit? Answer: Since rollback provisions are for past years, ALP for the rollback years would be agreed after full examination of all the facts, including validation of critical assumptions. Hence, compliance audit for the rollback years would primarily be to check if the agreed price or methodology has been applied in the modified return. Q.10  Whether applicant has an option to withdraw its rollback application? Can the applicant accept the rollback results without accepting the APA for the future years? Answer:  The applicant has an option to withdraw its roll back application even while maintaining the APA application for the future years. However, it is not possible to accept the rollback results without accepting the APA for the future years. It may also be noted that the fee specified in Rule 10MA(5) shall not be refunded even where a rollback application is withdrawn. Q.11  For already concluded APAs, will new APAs be signed for rollback or earlier APAs could be revised? Answer: The second proviso to Rule 10MA(5) provides for revision of APAs already concluded to include rollback provisions. Q.12  For already concluded APAs, where the modified return has already been filed for the first year of the APA term, how will the time-limit for filing modified return for rollback years be determined? Answer: The time to file modified return for rollback years will start from the date of signing the revised APA incorporating the rollback provisions. Q.13  In case of merger of companies, where one or more of those companies are APA applicants, how would the rollback provisions be allowed and to which company or companies would it be allowed? Answer: The agreement is between the Board and a person. The principle to be followed in case of merger is that the person (company) who makes the APA"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 434 application would only be entitled to enter into the agreement and be entitled for the rollback provisions in respect of international transactions undertaken by it in rollback years. Other persons (companies) who have merged with this person (company) would not be eligible for the rollback provisions. To illustrate, if A, B and C merge to form C and C is the APA applicant, then the agreement can only be entered into with C and only C would be eligible for the rollback provisions. A and B would not be eligible for the rollback provisions. To illustrate further, if A and B merge to form a new company C and C is the APA applicant, then nobody would be eligible for rollback provisions. Q.14  In case of a demerger of an APA applicant or signatory into two or more companies (persons), who would be eligible for the rollback provisions? Answer: The same principle as mentioned in the previous answer, i.e., the person (company) who makes an APA application or enters into an APA would only be entitled for the rollback provisions, would continue to apply. To illustrate, if A has applied for or entered into an APA and, subsequently, demerges into A and B, then only A will be eligible for rollback for international transactions covered under the APA. As B was not in existence in rollback years, availing or grant of rollback to B does not arise. 7. INSTRUCTION NO. 3/2016 DATED 10TH MARCH, 2016 - GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF TRANSFER PRICING PROVISIONS - REPLACEMENT OF INSTRUCTION NO. 15/2015 The provisions relating to transfer pricing are contained in Sections 92 to 92F in Chapter X of the Income-tax Act, 1961. These provisions came into force w.e.f. Assessment Year 2002-2003 and have seen a number of amendments over the years, including the insertion of Safe Harbour and Advance Pricing Agreement provisions and the extension of the applicability of transfer pricing provisions to Specified Domestic Transactions. 2. In terms of the provisions, any income arising from an international transaction or specified domestic transaction between two or more associated enterprises shall be computed having regard to the Arm's Length Price. Instruction No. 3 was issued on 201h May, 2003 to provide guidance to the Transfer Pricing Officers (TPOs) and the Assessing Officers (AOs) to operationalise the transfer pricing provisions and to have procedural uniformity. Due to a number of legislative, procedural and structural changes carried out over the last few years, Instruction No."
3 of 2003 was replaced
"Annexure IV 435 with Instruction No. 15/2015, dated 161h October, 2015. After the issuance of Instruction No. 15/2015, the Board has received some suggestions and queries, which have been examined in detail. Accordingly, this Instruction is being issued to replace Instruction No. 15 of 2015. This Instruction is applicable for both international transactions and specified domestic transactions between associated enterprises. The guidelines on various issues are as follows:  3. Reference to Transfer Pricing Officer {TPO) 3.1  The power to determine the Arm's Length Price (ALP) in an international transaction or specified domestic transaction is contained in sub-section (3) of Section 92C. However, Section 92CA provides that where the Assessing Officer (AO) considers it necessary or expedient so to do, he may refer the computation of ALP in relation to an international transaction or specified domestic transaction to the TPO. For proper administration of the Income-tax Act, the Board has decided that the AO shall henceforth make a reference to the TPO only under the circumstances laid out in this Instruction. 3.2  All cases selected for scrutiny, either under the Computer Assisted Scrutiny Selection [CASS] system or under the compulsory manual selection system (in accordance with the CBDT's annual instructions in this regard - for example, Instruction No. 6/2014 for selection in F.Y 2014-15 and Instruction No. 8/2015 for selection in F.Y 2015-16), on the basis of transfer pricing risk parameters [in respect of international transactions or specified domestic transactions or both] have to be referred to the TPO by the AO, after obtaining the approval of the jurisdictional Principal Commissioner of Income-tax (PCIT) or Commissioner of Income-tax (CIT). The fact that a case has been selected for scrutiny on a TP risk parameter becomes clear from a perusal of the reasons for which a particular case has been selected and the same are invariably available with the jurisdictional AO. Thus, if the reason or one of the reasons for selection of a case for scrutiny is a TP risk parameter, then the case has to be mandatorily referred to the TPO by the AO, after obtaining the approval of the jurisdictional PCIT or CIT. 3.3  Cases selected for scrutiny on non-transfer pricing risk parameters but also having international transactions or specified domestic transactions, shall be referred to TPOs only in the following circumstances:  (a) where the AO comes to know that the taxpayer has entered into international transactions or specified domestic transactions or both but the taxpayer has either not filed the Accountant's report under"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 436 Section 92E at all or has not disclosed the said transactions in the Accountant's report filed;  (b)  where there has been a transfer pricing adjustment of Rs. 1O Crore or more in an earlier assessment year and such adjustment has been upheld by the judicial authorities or is pending in appeal; and  (c)  where search and seizure or survey operations have been carried out under the provisions of the Income-tax Act and findings regarding transfer pricing issues in respect of international transactions or specified domestic transactions or both have been recorded by the Investigation Wing or the AO. 3.4 For cases to be referred by the AO to the TPO in accordance with paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 above, in respect of transactions having the following situations, the AO must, as a jurisdictional requirement, record his satisfaction that there is an income or a potential of an income arising and/or being affected on determination of the ALP of an international transaction or specified domestic transaction before seeking approval of the PCIT or CIT to refer the matter to the TPO for determination of the ALP:  where the taxpayer has not filed the Accountant's report under Section 92E of the Act but the international transactions or specified domestic transactions undertaken by it come to the notice of the AO;  where the taxpayer has not declared one or more international transaction or specified domestic transaction in the Accountant's report filed under Section 92E of the Act and the said transaction or transactions come to the notice of the AO; and   where the taxpayer has declared the international transactions or specified domestic transactions in the Accountant's report filed under Section 92E of the Act but has made certain qualifying remarks to the effect that the said transactions are not international transactions or specified domestic transactions or they do not impact the income of the taxpayer. In the above three situations, the AO must provide an opportunity of being heard to the taxpayer before recording his satisfaction or otherwise. In case no objection is raised by the taxpayer to the applicability of Chapter X [Sections 92 to 92F] of the Act to these three situations, then AO should refer the international transaction or specified domestic transaction to the TPO for determining the ALP after obtaining the approval of the PCIT or CIT. However, where the applicability of Chapter X [Sections 92 to 92F] to these"
"Annexure IV 437 three situations is objected to by the taxpayer, the AO must consider the taxpayer's objections and pass a speaking order so as to comply with the principles of natural justice. If the AO decides in the said order that the transaction in question needs to be referred to the TPO, he should make a reference after obtaining the approval of the PCIT or CIT. 3.5 In addition to the cases to be referred as per paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3, a case involving a transfer pricing adjustment in an earlier assessment year that has been fully or partially set-aside by the ITAT, High Court or Supreme Court on the issue of the said adjustment shall invariably be referred to the TPO for determination of the ALP. 3.6 Since the provisions of Section 92CA of the Act, inter-alia, refer to the computation of the ALP of the international transaction or specified domestic transaction, it is imperative for the AO to ensure that all international transactions or relevant specified domestic transactions or both, as the case may be, are explicitly mentioned in the letter through which the reference is made to the TPO. In this regard, guidelines as under may be followed:  (a)  If a case has been selected for scrutiny on a TP risk parameter pertaining to international transactions only, then the international transactions shall alone be referred to the TPO; (b)  If a case has been selected for scrutiny on a TP risk parameter pertaining to specified domestic transactions only, then the specified domestic transactions shall alone be referred to the TPO; and  (c)  If a case has been selected for scrutiny on the basis of TP risk parameters pertaining to both international transactions and specified domestic transactions, then the international transactions and the specified domestic transactions shall together be referred to the TPO. Since international transactions may be benchmarked together at the entity level due to the inter-linkages amongst them, if a case has been selected for scrutiny on a TP risk parameter pertaining to one or more international transactions, then all the international transactions entered into by the taxpayer - except those about which the AO has decided not to make a reference as per paragraph 3.4 - shall be referred to the TPO. 3.7  For administering the transfer pricing regime in an efficient manner, it is clarified that though AO has the power under Section 92C to determine the ALP of international transactions or specified domestic transactions, determination of ALP should not be carried out at all by the AO in a case"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 438 where reference is not made to the TPO. However, in such cases, the AO must record in the body of the assessment order that due to the Board's Instruction on this matter, the transfer pricing issue has not been examined at all. 4. Role of Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) 4.1  The role of the TPO begins after a reference is received from the AO. In terms of Section 92CA, this role is limited to the determination of the ALP in relation to international transactions or specified domestic transactions referred to him by the AO. However, if any other international transaction comes to the notice of the TPO during the course of the proceedings before him, then he is empowered to determine the ALP of such other international transactions also by virtue of Section 92CA (2A) and (2B). The transfer price has to be determined by the TPO in terms of Section 92C. The price has to be determined by using any one of the methods stipulated in sub-section (1) of Section 92C and by applying the most appropriate method referred to in Sub-section (2) thereof. There may be occasions where application of the most appropriate method provides results which are different but equally reliable. In all such cases, further scrutiny may be necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of the method, the correctness of the data, weight given to various factors and so on. The selection of the most appropriate method will depend upon the facts of the case and the factors mentioned in Rule 1OC. The TPO, after taking into account all relevant facts and data available to him, shall determine the ALP and pass a speaking order. 4.2  The TPO's order should contain details of the data used, reasons for arriving at a certain price and the applicability of methods. It may be emphasised that the application of method including the application of the most appropriate method, the data used, factors governing the applicability of respective methods, computation of price under a given method will all be subjected to judicial scrutiny. It is, therefore, necessary that the order of the TPO contains adequate reasons on all these counts. Copies of the documents or the relevant data used in arriving at the arm's length price should be made available to the AO for his records and the use at subsequent stages of appellate or penal proceedings. 4.3  The TPO, being an Additional/ Joint CIT, shall obtain the approval of the jurisdictional CIT (Transfer Pricing) before passing the order. On the other hand, the TPO, being a Deputy I Assistant CIT, shall obtain the approval of the jurisdictional Additional/ Joint CIT before passing the order. The jurisdictional CIT (TP} should assign a limited number of important and"
"Annexure IV 439 complex cases, not exceeding 50, to the Additional/ Joint CslT (TPOs) working in the same jurisdiction. For the selection of such important and complex cases by the CslT (TP), the concerned CCslT (International Taxation) shall frame appropriate guidelines. 4.4  In addition to the above, the TPO is required to carry out the Compliance Audit of the Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) entered into by the Board and the taxpayers in accordance with Rule 1OP of the Income-tax Rules. 4.5  The TPO is also required to play an important role in respect of Safe Harbour provisions. Whenever a reference is made to the TPO under subrule (4) or sub-rule (10) of Rule 1OTE of the Income-tax Rules, the TPO has to carefully examine all the facts and circumstances of the taxpayer's exercise of an option for Safe Harbour and pass an order in writing as mandated in sub-rule (6) or sub-rule (11) of the said Rule, respectively. 5. Role of the AO after Determination of ALP by the TPO  Under sub-section (4) of Section 92C (read with sub-section (4) of Section 92CA), the AO has to compute the total income of the assessee in conformity with the ALP determined by the TPO under sub-section (3) of Section 92CA. 6. Maintenance of Data Base It is to be ensured by the CIT (TP) that the references received from the AOs by the TPOs in his jurisdiction are dealt with expeditiously and accurate record of all events connected with the whole process of determination of ALP is maintained. This record is to be maintained by each TPO, separately for international transactions and specified domestic transactions, in the formats enclosed as Annexure-1 and Annexure-11 to this Instruction and the same shall be maintained electronically on the Department's ITBA system as and when the same becomes fully functional.

"     Annexure V Mandatory Communication - Relevant Extracts from the Code of Ethics  (Twelfth Edition – May 2020)  2.14.1.8 A Chartered Accountant in practice shall be deemed to be guilty of professional misconduct, if he :- Clause (8): accepts a position as auditor previously held by another chartered accountant or a certified auditor who has been issued certificate under the Restricted Certificate Rules, 1932 without first communicating with him in writing; 2.14.1.8 (i)   It must be pointed out that professional courtesy alone is not the major reason for requiring a member to communicate with the existing accountant who is a member of the Institute or a certified auditor. The underlying objective is that the member may have an opportunity to know the reasons for the change in order to be able to safeguard his own interest, the legitimate interest of the public and the independence of the existing accountant. It is not intended, in any way, to prevent or obstruct the change. When making the enquiry from the retiring auditor, the one proposed to be appointed or already appointed should primarily find out whether there are any professional or other reasons why he should not accept the appointment. 2.14.1.8 (ii)  It is important to remember that every client has an inherent right to choose his accountant; also that he may, subject to compliance with the statutory requirements in the case of limited Companies, make a change whenever he chooses, whether or not the reasons which had impelled him to do so are good and valid. The change normally occurs where there has been a change of venue of business and a local accountant is preferred or where the partner who has been dealing with the clients affairs retires or dies; or where temperaments clash or the client has some good reasons to feel dissatisfied. In such"
"Annexure V 455 cases, the retiring auditor should always accept the situation with good grace. Grounds for Non-acceptance of Audit  2.14.1.8 (iii) The existence of a dispute as regards the fees may be root cause of an auditor being changed. This would not constitute valid professional reasons on account of which an audit should not be accepted by the member to whom it is offered. However, in the case of an undisputed audit fees for carrying out the statutory audit under the Companies Act, 2013 or various other statutes having not been paid, the incoming auditor should not accept the appointment unless such fees are paid. In respect of other dues, the incoming auditor should in appropriate circumstances use his influence in favour of his predecessor to have the dispute as regards the fees settled. The professional reasons for not accepting an audit would be:   (a) Non-compliance of the provisions of Sections 139 and 140 of the Companies Act, 2013 as mentioned in Clause (9) of the Part - I of First Schedule to The Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 ; and   (b) Non-payment of undisputed Audit Fees by auditees other than in case of Sick Units for carrying out the Statutory Audit under the Companies Act, 2013 or various other statutes; and         (c)     Issuance of a qualified report. 2.14.1.8 (iv)  In the first two cases, an auditor who accepts the audit would be guilty of professional misconduct. In this connection, attention of members is invited to the Council General Guidelines, 2008 appearing in Chapter-4. In the said Guidelines, Council has explained that the provision for audit fee in accounts signed by both the auditee and the auditor along with other expenses, if any, incurred by the auditor in connection with the audit, shall be considered as “undisputed audit fee” and “sick unit” shall mean a unit registered for not less than five years, which has at the end of any financial year accumulated losses equal to or exceeding its entire net worth."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 456 Recourse in case of Qualified Audit Report 2.14.1.8 (v)  In the last case, however, he may accept the audit if he is satisfied that the attitude of the retiring auditor was not proper and justified. If, on the other hand, he feels that the retiring auditor had qualified the report for good and valid reasons, he should refuse to accept the audit. There is no rule, written or unwritten, which would prevent an auditor from accepting the appointment offered to him in these circumstances. However, before accepting the audit, he should ascertain the full facts of the case. For nothing will bring the profession to disrepute so much as the knowledge amongst the public that if an auditor is found to be “inconvenient” by the client, he could readily be replaced by another who would not displease the client and this point cannot be too over-emphasised. Fees pending due to non-availability of Previous Auditor  2.14.1.8 (vi)  Where the previous auditor is not available for accepting payment of undisputed audit fees, and it is not otherwise possible to transfer the payment to him electronically, the incoming auditor may advise the client to purchase Demand Draft of the amount equivalent to undisputed Audit Fees of retiring auditor, and may accept the Audit assignment after verifying the same. It will be the duty of the incoming auditor to ensure the payment of undisputed Audit Fees of the retiring auditor at the earliest possibility. Course of action in case of change of Auditorship  2.14.1.8 (vii) What should be the correct procedure to adopt when a prospective client tells you that he wants to change his auditor and wants you to take up his work? There being two persons involved, the Company and the old auditor, the former should be asked whether the retiring auditor had been informed of the intention to change. If the answer is in the affirmative, then a communication should be addressed to the retiring auditor. If, however, it is learnt that the old auditor has not been informed, and the client is not willing to make the first move, it would be necessary to ask him the reason for the proposed change. If there is no valid reason for a change, it would be healthy practice not to accept the audit. If he decides to accept the audit he should address a communication to the retiring auditor."
"Annexure V 457   As stated earlier, the object of the incoming auditor, in communicating with the retiring auditor is to ascertain from him whether there are any circumstances which warrant him not to accept the appointment. For example, whether the previous auditor has been changed on account of having qualified his report or he had expressed a wish not to continue on account of something inherently wrong with the administration of the business. The retiring auditor may even give out information regarding the condition of the accounts of the client or the reason that impelled him to qualify his report. In all these cases it would be essential for the incoming auditor to carefully consider the facts before deciding whether or not he should accept the audit, and should he do so, he must also take into account the information while discharging his duties and responsibilities. Duty of Retiring Auditor  2.14.1.8(viii) On the request of the incoming auditor to the retiring auditor for providing known information regarding any facts or other information of which, in the opinion of the retiring auditor, the incoming auditor needs to be aware before deciding whether to accept the engagement, the retiring auditor shall provide the information diligently. Sometimes, the retiring auditor fails without justifiable cause except a feeling of hurt because of the change, to respond to the communication of the incoming auditor. So that it may not create a deadlock, the incoming auditor appointed can act, after waiting for a reasonable time for a reply. Certificate of Posting not a conclusive proof of communication  2.14.1.8 (ix) The Council has taken the view that a mere posting of a letter under certificate of posting is not sufficient to establish communication with the retiring auditor unless there is some evidence to show that the letter has in fact reached the person communicated with. A Chartered Accountant who relies solely upon a letter posted under certificate of posting therefore does so at his own risk. The view taken by the Council has been confirmed in a decision by the Rajasthan High Court in J.S. Bhati vs. The Council of the"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 458 Institute of the Chartered Accountants of India and another. (Pages 72-79 of Vol. V of Disciplinary Cases published by the Institute - Judgement delivered on 29th August, 1975). The following observations of the Court are relevant in this context:-    “Mere obtaining a certificate of posting in my opinion does not fulfill the requirements of clause (8) of Schedule I as the presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence Act that the letter in due course reached the addressee cannot replace that positive degree of proof of the delivery of the letter to the addressee which the letters of the law in this case require. The expression ‘in communication with’ when read in the light of the instructions contained in the booklet ‘Code of Conduct’ cannot be interpreted in any other manner but to mean that there should be positive evidence of the fact that the communication addressed to the outgoing auditor by the incoming auditor reached his hands. Certificate of posting of a letter cannot, in the circumstances, be taken as positive evidence of its delivery to the addressee.” Positive Evidence of Delivery  required  2.14.1.8 (x)  Members should therefore communicate with a retiring auditor in such a manner as to retain in their hands positive evidence of the delivery of the communication to the addressee. In the opinion of the Council, the following would in the normal course provide such evidence:-   (a)  Communication by a letter sent through “Registered Acknowledgement due”, or    (b)  By hand against a written acknowledgement, or    (c)  Acknowledgement of the communication from retiring auditor’s vide email address registered with the Institute or his last known official email address, or    (d)  Unique Identification Number (UDIN) generated on UDIN portal (subject to separate guidelines to be issued by the Council in this regard)  Premises found Locked  2.14.1.8 (xi) The communication received back by the incoming auditor with “Office found Locked” written on the Acknowledgement Due shall be deemed as having been delivered to the retiring auditor."
"Annexure V 459 Firm not found at the given Registered Address  2.14.1.8 (xii) If the Communication sent by the incoming auditor is received back with remarks “No such office exists at this address”, and the address of communication is the same as registered with the Institute on the date of dispatch, the letter will be deemed to be delivered, unless the retiring auditor proves that it was not really served and that he was not responsible for such non-service. As a matter of professional courtesy and professional obligation it is necessary for the new auditor appointed to act jointly with the earlier auditor and to communicate with such earlier auditor. Special Audit under Income Tax Act, 1961  2.14.1.8(xiii) It would be a healthy practice if a Tax Auditor appointed for conducting special audit under the Income Tax Act,1961 communicates with the member who has conducted the Statutory Audit. The Council has also laid down the detailed guidelines on the subject as under:- Communication required for all kinds of audit  2.14.1.8(xiv) The requirement for communicating with the previous auditor being a Chartered Accountant in practice would apply to all types of Audit viz., Statutory Audit, Tax Audit, GST Audit, Internal Audit, Concurrent Audit or any other kind of audit. Communication in case of Assignments done by other professionals  2.14.1.8(xv) A Communication is mandatorily required for all types of Audit/Report where the previous auditor is a Chartered Accountant. In case of assignments done by other professionals not being Chartered Accountants, it would also be a healthy practice to communicate. Lack of time in acceptance of Government Audits 2.14.1.8(xvi) Although the mandatory requirement of communication with previous auditor being Chartered Accountant applies, in uniform manner, to audits of both government and Non-Government entities, yet in the case of audit of government Companies/ banks or their branches, if the appointment is made well in time to enable the obligation cast under this clause to be fulfilled,"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 460 such obligation must be complied with before accepting the audit. However, in case the time schedule given for the assignment is such that there is no time to wait for the reply from the outgoing auditor, the incoming auditor may give a conditional acceptance of the appointment and commence the work which needs to be attended to immediately after he has sent the communication to the previous auditor in accordance with this clause. In his acceptance letter, he should make clear to the client that his acceptance of appointment is subject to professional objections, if any, from the previous auditors and that he will decide about his final acceptance after taking into account the information received from the previous auditor. Meaning of Terms  2.14.1.8(xvii) Various doubts have been raised by the members about the terms “audit”, “previous auditor”, “Certificate” and “report”, normally while interpreting the aforesaid Clause (8). These terms need to be clarified. The definition of “Audit” is given in the Framework for Assurance Engagements (the Framework) issued by the Institute which is as under:  “For assurance engagements relating to historical financial information in particular, such engagements which provide reasonable assurance are called audits”. The Framework also describes the objective of reasonable assurance engagements which is as under:   The objective of a reasonable assurance engagement is a reduction in assurance engagement risk to an acceptably low level in the circumstances of the engagement as the basis for a positive form of expression of the practitioner’s conclusion. The term “previous auditor” means the immediately preceding auditor who held same or similar assignment comprising same/similar scope of work. For example, a Chartered Accountant in practice appointed for an assignment of physical verification of inventory of raw materials, spares, stores and finished goods, before acceptance of appointment, must communicate with the"
"Annexure V 461 previous auditor being a Chartered Accountant in practice who was holding the appointment of physical verification of inventory of raw materials, stores, finished goods and fixed assets. The mandatory communication with the previous auditor being a Chartered Accountant is required even in a case where the previous auditor happens to be an auditor for a year other than the immediately preceding year. “Auditor’s Report” mentioned in SA 700 states the objective of the Report as forming an opinion on the financial statements based on an evaluation of the conclusions drawn from the audit evidence obtained. As explained in the Institute’s publication viz., ‘Guidance Note on Reports and Certificates for Special Purposes’ (which governs reports other than those which are issued in audits or reviews) states that the word ‘certificate’ as described in the laws and regulations or even in the contracts that an entity might have entered into can normally be associated with reasonable assurance. A practitioner is expected to provide either a reasonable assurance (about whether the subject matter of examination is materially misstated) or a limited assurance (stating that nothing has come to the practitioner’s attention that causes the practitioner to believe that the subject matter is materially misstated). A practitioner is not expected to reduce the engagement risk to zero. Therefore, whenever a practitioner is required to give a “certificate” or a “report” for special purpose, the practitioner needs to undertake a careful evaluation of the scope of the engagement, i.e., whether the practitioner would be able to provide reasonable assurance or limited assurance on the subject matter."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 462 Relevant Extracts from Volume-I of Code of Ethics  SECTION 320 PROFESSIONAL APPOINTMENTS Introduction 320.1  Professional accountants are required to comply with the fundamental principles and apply the conceptual framework set out in Section 120 to identify, evaluate and address threats. 320.2  Acceptance of a new client relationship or changes in an existing engagement might create a threat to compliance with one or more of the fundamental principles. This section sets out specific requirements and application material relevant to applying the conceptual framework in such circumstances. Requirements and Application Material Client and Engagement Acceptance General 320.3 A1 Threats to compliance with the principles of integrity or professional behaviour might be created, for example, from questionable issues associated with the client (its owners, management or activities). Issues that, if known, might create such a threat include client involvement in illegal activities, dishonesty, questionable financial reporting practices or other unethical behaviour. 320.3 A2 Factors that are relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat include:  Knowledge and understanding of the client, its owners, management and those charged with governance and business activities. The client’s commitment to address the questionable issues, for example, through improving corporate governance practices or internal controls. 320.3  A3 A self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence and due care is created if the engagement team does not possess, or cannot acquire, the competencies to perform the professional services."

Knowledge of relevant industries or subject matter. Experience with relevant regulatory or reporting requirements. The existence of quality control policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that engagements are accepted only when they can be performed competently. 320.3 A5 Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address a self-interest threat include:  Assigning sufficient engagement personnel with the necessary competencies.

"Annexure V 465 Changes in a Professional Appointment General R320.4  Subject to compliance with the provisions of Clause (8) of Part-I of First Schedule to The Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, and Council directions thereunder, a professional accountant, shall determine whether there are any reasons for not accepting an engagement when the accountant: (a) Is asked by a potential client to replace another accountant; (b) Considers tendering for an engagement held by another accountant subject to compliance with council guidelines dated 7th April, 2016 issued in this regard, as amended from time to time; or (c) Considers undertaking work that is complementary or additional to that of another accountant. 320.4 A1  There might be reasons for not accepting an engagement. One such reason might be if a threat created by the facts and circumstances cannot be addressed by applying safeguards. For example, there might be a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence and due care if a professional accountant accepts the engagement before knowing all the relevant facts. 320.4 A2  If a professional accountant is asked to undertake work that is complementary or additional to the work of an existing or predecessor accountant, a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of professional competence and due care might be created, for example, as a result of incomplete information. 320.4  A3  A factor that is relevant in evaluating the level of such a threat is whether tenders state that, before accepting the engagement, contact with the existing or predecessor accountant will be requested. This contact gives the proposed accountant the opportunity to inquire whether there are any reasons why the engagement should not be accepted. 320.4 A4 Examples of actions that might be safeguards to address such a self-interest threat include:"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 466  Asking the existing or predecessor accountant to provide any known information of which, in the existing or predecessor accountant’s opinion, the proposed accountant needs to be aware before deciding whether to accept the engagement. For example, inquiry might reveal previously undisclosed pertinent facts and might indicate disagreements with the existing or predecessor accountant that might influence the decision to accept the appointment.

For example, a self-interest threat to compliance with the principle of integrity might be created by improper earnings management or balance sheet valuations.

"Annexure VII 489 Using the Work of the Internal Audit Function  .................................. A24-A30 Determining Whether, in Which Areas, and to What Extent Internal Auditors Can Be Used to Provide Direct Assistance ............. A31-A39 Using Internal Auditors to Provide Direct Assistance  ........................ A40-A41 Standard on Auditing (SA) 610(Revised), “Using the Work of Internal Auditors”, should be read in the context of the “Preface to the Standards on Quality Control, Auditing, Review, Other Assurance and Related Services,” which sets out the authority of SAs and SA 200, “Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance with Standards on Auditing”. Introduction Scope of this SA  1. This Standard on Auditing (SA) deals with the external auditor’s responsibilities if using the work of internal auditors. This includes (a) using the work of the internal audit function in obtaining audit evidence and (b) using internal auditors to provide direct assistance under the direction, supervision and review of the external auditor. 2. This SA does not apply if the entity does not have an internal audit function. (Ref: Para. A2) 3. If the entity has an internal audit function, the requirements in this SA relating to using the work of that function do not apply if: (a) The responsibilities and activities of the function are not relevant to the audit; or  (b) Based on the auditor’s preliminary understanding of the function obtained as a result of procedures performed under SA 315,2 the external auditor does not expect to use the work of the function in obtaining audit evidence. Nothing in this SA requires the external auditor to use the work of the internal audit function to modify the nature or timing, or reduce the extent, of audit procedures to be performed directly by the external auditor; it remains a decision of the external auditor in establishing the overall audit strategy. 2 SA 315, Identifying and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement through Understanding the Entity and Its Environment."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 490 4. Furthermore, the requirements in this SA relating to direct assistance do not apply if the external auditor does not plan to use internal auditors to provide direct assistance. 5. In some cases, the external auditor may be prohibited, or restricted to some extent, by law or regulation from using the work of the internal audit function or using internal auditors to provide direct assistance. The SAs do not override laws or regulations that govern an audit of financial statements.3 Such prohibitions or restrictions will therefore not prevent the external auditor from complying with the SAs. (Ref: Para. A31) Relationship between SA 315 and SA 610 (Revised) 6. Many entities establish internal audit functions as part of their internal control and governance structures. The objectives and scope of an internal audit function, the nature of its responsibilities and its organizational status, including the function’s authority and accountability, vary widely and depend on the size and structure of the entity and the requirements of management and, where applicable, those charged with governance. 7. SA 315 addresses how the knowledge and experience of the internal audit function can inform the external auditor’s understanding of the entity and its environment and identification and assessment of risks of material misstatement. SA 3154 also explains how effective communication between the internal and external auditors also creates an environment in which the external auditor can be informed of significant matters that may affect the external auditor’s work. 8. Depending on whether the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures adequately support the objectivity of the internal auditors, the level of competency of the internal audit function, and whether the function applies a systematic and disciplined approach, the external auditor may also be able to use the work of the internal audit function in a constructive and complementary manner. This SA addresses the external auditor’s responsibilities when, based on the external auditor’s preliminary understanding of the internal audit function obtained as a result of procedures performed under SA 315, the external auditor expects to use the work of the internal audit function as part of the audit evidence  3 SA 200, Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance with Standards on Auditing, paragraph A56. 4 SA 315, Paragraph A115."
"Annexure VII 491 obtained.5 Such use of that work modifies the nature or timing, or reduces the extent, of audit procedures to be performed directly by the external auditor. 9. In addition, this SA also addresses the external auditor’s responsibilities if considering using internal auditors to provide direct assistance under the direction, supervision and review of the external auditor. 10. There may be individuals in an entity that perform procedures similar to those performed by an internal audit function. However, unless performed by an objective and competent function that applies a systematic and disciplined approach, including quality control, such procedures would be considered internal controls and obtaining evidence regarding the effectiveness of such controls would be part of the auditor’s responses to assessed risks in accordance with SA 330.6 The External Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit 11. The external auditor has sole responsibility for the audit opinion expressed, and that responsibility is not reduced by the external auditor’s use of the work of the internal audit function or internal auditors to provide direct assistance on the engagement. Although they may perform audit procedures similar to those performed by the external auditor, neither the internal audit function nor the internal auditors are independent of the entity as is required of the external auditor in an audit of financial statements in accordance with SA 200.7 This SA, therefore, defines the conditions that are necessary for the external auditor to be able to use the work of internal auditors. It also defines the necessary work effort to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence that the work of the internal audit function, or internal auditors providing direct assistance, is adequate for the purposes of the audit. The requirements are designed to provide a framework for the external auditor’s judgments regarding the use of the work of internal auditors to prevent over or undue use of such work. Effective Date 12. This SA is effective for audits of financial statements for periods beginning on or after 1st April, 2016. 5 See paragraphs 15–25. 6 SA 330,The Auditor’s Responses to Assessed Risks. 7 SA 200, paragraph 14."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 492 Objectives 13. The objectives of the external auditor, where the entity has an internal audit function and the external auditor expects to use the work of the function to modify the nature or timing, or reduce the extent, of audit procedures to be performed directly by the external auditor, or to use internal auditors to provide direct assistance, are:  (a) To determine whether the work of the internal audit function or direct assistance from internal auditors can be used, and if so, in which areas and to what extent; and having made that determination: (b)  If using the work of the internal audit function, to determine whether that work is adequate for purposes of the audit; and (c) If using internal auditors to provide direct assistance, to appropriately direct, supervise and review their work. Definitions 14. For purposes of the SAs, the following terms have the meanings attributed below: (a) Internal audit function – A function of an entity that performs assurance and consulting activities designed to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the entity’s governance, risk management and internal control processes. (Ref: Para. A1–A4) (b) Direct assistance – The use of internal auditors to perform audit procedures under the direction, supervision and review of the external auditor. Requirements Determining Whether, in Which Areas, and to What Extent the Work of the Internal Audit Function Can Be Used Evaluating the Internal Audit Function 15. The external auditor shall determine whether the work of the internal audit function can be used for purposes of the audit by evaluating the following: (a) The extent to which the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures support the objectivity of the internal auditors; (Ref: Para. A5–A9)"
"Annexure VII 493 (b) The level of competence of the internal audit function; and (Ref: Para. A5–A9) (c) Whether the internal audit function applies a systematic and disciplined approach, including quality control. (Ref: Para. A10–A11) 16. The external auditor shall not use the work of the internal audit function if the external auditor determines that: (a) The function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures do not adequately support the objectivity of internal auditors; (b) The function lacks sufficient competence; or (c) The function does not apply a systematic and disciplined approach, including quality control. (Ref: Para. A12–A14) Determining the Nature and Extent of Work of the Internal Audit Function that Can Be Used 17. As a basis for determining the areas and the extent to which the work of the internal audit function can be used, the external auditor shall consider the nature and scope of the work that has been performed, or is planned to be performed, by the internal audit function and its relevance to the external auditor’s overall audit strategy and audit plan. (Ref: Para. A15–A17) 18. The external auditor shall make all significant judgments in the audit engagement and, to prevent undue use of the work of the internal audit function, shall plan to use less of the work of the function and perform more of the work directly: (Ref: Para. A15–A17) (a) The more judgment is involved in: (i) Planning and performing relevant audit procedures; and (ii) Evaluating the audit evidence gathered; (Ref: Para. A18–A19) (b) The higher the assessed risk of material misstatement at the assertion level, with special consideration given to risks identified as significant; (Ref: Para. A20–A22) (c) The less the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures adequately support the objectivity of the internal auditors; and (d) The lower the level of competence of the internal audit function."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 494 19. The external auditor shall also evaluate whether, in aggregate, using the work of the internal audit function to the extent planned would still result in the external auditor being sufficiently involved in the audit, given the external auditor’s sole responsibility for the audit opinion expressed. (Ref: Para. A15–A22) 20. The external auditor shall, in communicating with those charged with governance an overview of the planned scope and timing of the audit in accordance with SA 260(Revised),8 communicate how the external auditor has planned to use the work of the internal audit function. (Ref: Para. A23) Using the Work of the Internal Audit Function 21. If the external auditor plans to use the work of the internal audit function, the external auditor shall discuss the planned use of its work with the function as a basis for coordinating their respective activities. (Ref: Para. A24–A26) 22. The external auditor shall read the reports of the internal audit function relating to the work of the function that the external auditor plans to use to obtain an understanding of the nature and extent of audit procedures it performed and the related findings. 23. The external auditor shall perform sufficient audit procedures on the body of work of the internal audit function as a whole that the external auditor plans to use to determine its adequacy for purposes of the audit, including evaluating whether: (a) The work of the function had been properly planned, performed, supervised, reviewed and documented; (b) Sufficient appropriate evidence had been obtained to enable the function to draw reasonable conclusions; and (c) Conclusions reached are appropriate in the circumstances and the reports prepared by the function are consistent with the results of the work performed. (Ref: Para. A27–A30) 24. The nature and extent of the external auditor’s audit procedures shall be responsive to the external auditor’s evaluation of: (a) The amount of judgment involved; (b) The assessed risk of material misstatement;  8 SA 260(Revised), Communication with Those Charged with Governance, paragraph 15."
"Annexure VII 495 (c) The extent to which the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures support the objectivity of the internal auditors; and (d) The level of competence of the function;9 (Ref: Para. A27–A29) and shall include reperformance of some of the work. (Ref: Para. A30) 25. The external auditor shall also evaluate whether the external auditor’s conclusions regarding the internal audit function in paragraph 15 of this SA and the determination of the nature and extent of use of the work of the function for purposes of the audit in paragraphs 18–19 of this SA remain appropriate. Determining Whether, in Which Areas, and to What Extent Internal Auditors Can Be Used to Provide Direct Assistance Determining Whether Internal Auditors Can Be Used to Provide Direct Assistance for Purposes of the Audit 26. The external auditor may be prohibited by law or regulation from obtaining direct assistance from internal auditors. If so, paragraphs 27–35 and 37 do not apply. (Ref: Para. A31) 27. If using internal auditors to provide direct assistance is not prohibited by law or regulation, and the external auditor plans to use internal auditors to provide direct assistance on the audit, the external auditor shall evaluate the existence and significance of threats to objectivity and the level of competence of the internal auditors who will be providing such assistance. The external auditor’s evaluation of the existence and significance of threats to the internal auditors’ objectivity shall include inquiry of the internal auditors regarding interests and relationships that may create a threat to their objectivity. (Ref: Para. A32–A34) 28. The external auditor shall not use an internal auditor to provide direct assistance if:  (a) There are significant threats to the objectivity of the internal auditor; or (b) The internal auditor lacks sufficient competence to perform the proposed work. (Ref: Para. A32–A34)  9 See paragraph 18."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 496 Determining the Nature and Extent of Work that Can Be Assigned to Internal Auditors Providing Direct Assistance 29. In determining the nature and extent of work that may be assigned to internal auditors and the nature, timing and extent of direction, supervision and review that is appropriate in the circumstances, the external auditor shall consider: (a) The amount of judgment involved in: (i) Planning and performing relevant audit procedures; and (ii) Evaluating the audit evidence gathered; (b)  The assessed risk of material misstatement; and (c) The external auditor’s evaluation of the existence and significance of threats to the objectivity and level of competence of the internal auditors who will be providing such assistance. (Ref: Para. A35–A39) 30. The external auditor shall not use internal auditors to provide direct assistance to perform procedures that: (a)  Involve making significant judgments in the audit; (Ref: Para. A19) (b) Relate to higher assessed risks of material misstatement where the judgment required in performing the relevant audit procedures or evaluating the audit evidence gathered is more than limited; (Ref: Para.

(Ref: Para. A35–A39) 31.

Using Internal Auditors to Provide Direct Assistance 33. Prior to using internal auditors to provide direct assistance for purposes of the audit, the external auditor shall: (a) Obtain written agreement from an authorized representative of the entity that the internal auditors will be allowed to follow the external auditor’s instructions, and that the entity will not intervene in the work the internal auditor performs for the external auditor; and  (b) Obtain written agreement from the internal auditors that they will keep confidential specific matters as instructed by the external auditor and inform the external auditor of any threat to their objectivity. 34.

"Annexure VII 499 Application and Other Explanatory Material Definition of Internal Audit Function (Ref: Para. 2, 14(a)) A1. The objectives and scope of internal audit functions typically include assurance and consulting activities designed to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the entity’s governance processes, risk management and internal control such as the following: Activities Relating to Governance  The internal audit function may assess the governance process in its accomplishment of objectives on ethics and values, performance management and accountability, communicating risk and control information to appropriate areas of the organization and effectiveness of communication among those charged with governance, external and internal auditors, and management. Activities Relating to Risk Management  The internal audit function may assist the entity by identifying and evaluating significant exposures to risk and contributing to the improvement of risk management and internal control (including effectiveness of the financial reporting process). The internal audit function may perform procedures to assist the entity in the detection of fraud. Activities Relating to Internal Control  Evaluation of internal control. The internal audit function may be assigned specific responsibility for reviewing controls, evaluating their operation and recommending improvements thereto. In doing so, the internal audit function provides assurance on the control. For example, the internal audit function might plan and perform tests or other procedures to provide assurance to management and those charged with governance regarding the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of internal control, including those controls that are relevant to the audit. Examination of financial and operating information. The internal audit function may be assigned to review the means used to identify, recognize, measure, classify and report financial and operating information, and to make specific inquiry into individual items, including detailed testing of transactions, balances and procedures."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 500  Review of operating activities. The internal audit function may be assigned to review the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of operating activities, including non-financial activities of an entity. Review of compliance with laws and regulations. The internal audit function may be assigned to review compliance with laws, regulations and other external requirements, and with management policies and directives and other internal requirements. A2. Activities similar to those performed by an internal audit function may be conducted by functions with other titles within an entity. Some or all of the activities of an internal audit function may also be outsourced to a third-party service provider. Neither the title of the function, nor whether it is performed by the entity or a third-party service provider, are sole determinants of whether or not the external auditor can use the work of the function. Rather, it is the nature of the activities; the extent to which the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures support the objectivity of the internal auditors; competence; and systematic and disciplined approach of the function that are relevant. References in this SA to the work of the internal audit function include relevant activities of other functions or third-party providers that have these characteristics. A3. In addition, those in the entity with operational and managerial duties and responsibilities outside of the internal audit function would ordinarily face threats to their objectivity that would preclude them from being treated as part of an internal audit function for the purpose of this SA, although they may perform control activities that can be tested in accordance with SA 330.13 For this reason, monitoring controls performed by an owner-manager would not be considered equivalent to an internal audit function. A4. While the objectives of an entity’s internal audit function and the external auditor differ, the function may perform audit procedures similar to those performed by the external auditor in an audit of financial statements. If so, the external auditor may make use of the function for purposes of the audit in one or more of the following ways:  To obtain information that is relevant to the external auditor’s assessments of the risks of material misstatement due to error or fraud. In this regard, SA 31514 requires the external auditor to obtain  13 See paragraph 10. 14 SA 315, paragraph 6(a)."
"Annexure VII 501 an understanding of the nature of the internal audit function’s responsibilities, its status within the organization, and the activities performed, or to be performed, and make inquiries of appropriate individuals within the internal audit function (if the entity has such a function); or  Unless prohibited, or restricted to some extent, by law or regulation, the external auditor, after appropriate evaluation, may decide to use work that has been performed by the internal audit function during the period in partial substitution for audit evidence to be obtained directly by the external auditor.15 In addition, unless prohibited, or restricted to some extent, by law or regulation, the external auditor may use internal auditors to perform audit procedures under the direction, supervision and review of the external auditor (referred to as “direct assistance” in this SA).16 Determining Whether, in Which Areas, and to What Extent the Work of the Internal Audit Function Can Be Used Evaluating the Internal Audit Function Objectivity and Competence (Ref: Para. 15(a)–(b)) A5. The external auditor exercises professional judgment in determining whether the work of the internal audit function can be used for purposes of the audit, and the nature and extent to which the work of the internal audit function can be used in the circumstances. A6. The extent to which the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures support the objectivity of the internal auditors and the level of competence of the function are particularly important in determining whether to use and, if so, the nature and extent of the use of the work of the function that is appropriate in the circumstances. A7. Objectivity refers to the ability to perform those tasks without allowing bias, conflict of interest or undue influence of others to override professional judgments. Factors that may affect the external auditor’s evaluation include the following:  Whether the organizational status of the internal audit function, including the function’s authority and accountability, supports the  15 See paragraphs 15–25. 16 See paragraphs 26–35."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 502 ability of the function to be free from bias, conflict of interest or undue influence of others to override professional judgments. For example, whether the internal audit function reports to those charged with governance or an officer with appropriate authority, or if the function reports to management, whether it has direct access to those charged with governance. Whether the internal audit function is free of any conflicting responsibilities, for example, having managerial or operational duties or responsibilities that are outside of the internal audit function. Whether those charged with governance oversee employment decisions related to the internal audit function, for example, determining the appropriate remuneration policy. Whether there are any constraints or restrictions placed on the internal audit function by management or those charged with governance, for example, in communicating the internal audit function’s findings to the external auditor. Whether the internal auditors are members of relevant professional bodies and their memberships obligate their compliance with relevant professional standards relating to objectivity, or whether their internal policies achieve the same objectives. A8. Competence of the internal audit function refers to the attainment and maintenance of knowledge and skills of the function as a whole at the level required to enable assigned tasks to be performed diligently and in accordance with applicable professional standards. Factors that may affect the external auditor’s determination include the following:  Whether the internal audit function is adequately and appropriately resourced relative to the size of the entity and the nature of its operations. Whether there are established policies for hiring, training and assigning internal auditors to internal audit engagements. Whether the internal auditors have adequate technical training and proficiency in auditing. Relevant criteria that may be considered by the external auditor in making the assessment may include, for example, the internal auditors’ possession of a relevant professional designation and experience. Whether the internal auditors possess the required knowledge relating"
"Annexure VII 503 to the entity’s financial reporting and the applicable financial reporting framework and whether the internal audit function possesses the necessary skills (for example, industry-specific knowledge) to perform work related to the entity’s financial statements. Whether the internal auditors are members of relevant professional bodies that oblige them to comply with the relevant professional standards including continuing professional development requirements. A9. Objectivity and competence may be viewed as a continuum. The more the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures adequately support the objectivity of the internal auditors and the higher the level of competence of the function, the more likely the external auditor may make use of the work of the function and in more areas. However, an organizational status and relevant policies and procedures that provide strong support for the objectivity of the internal auditors cannot compensate for the lack of sufficient competence of the internal audit function. Equally, a high level of competence of the internal audit function cannot compensate for an organizational status and policies and procedures that do not adequately support the objectivity of the internal auditors. Application of a Systematic and Disciplined Approach (Ref: Para. 15(c)) A10. The application of a systematic and disciplined approach to planning, performing, supervising, reviewing and documenting its activities distinguishes the activities of the internal audit function from other monitoring control activities that may be performed within the entity. A11. Factors that may affect the external auditor’s determination of whether the internal audit function applies a systematic and disciplined approach include the following:  The existence, adequacy and use of documented internal audit procedures or guidance covering such areas as risk assessments, work programs, documentation and reporting, the nature and extent of which is commensurate with the size and circumstances of an entity. Whether the internal audit function has appropriate quality control policies and procedures, for example, such as those policies and procedures in SQC 117 that would be applicable to an internal audit  17 Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and"
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 504 function (such as those relating to leadership, human resources and engagement performance) or quality control requirements in standards set by the relevant professional bodies for internal auditors. Such bodies may also establish other appropriate requirements such as conducting periodic external quality assessments. Circumstances When Work of the Internal Audit Function Cannot Be Used (Ref: Para. 16) A12. The external auditor’s evaluation of whether the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures adequately support the objectivity of the internal auditors, the level of competence of the internal audit function, and whether it applies a systematic and disciplined approach may indicate that the risks to the quality of the work of the function are too significant and therefore it is not appropriate to use any of the work of the function as audit evidence. A13. Consideration of the factors in paragraphs A7, A8 and A11 of this SA individually and in aggregate is important because an individual factor is often not sufficient to conclude that the work of the internal audit function cannot be used for purposes of the audit. For example, the internal audit function’s organizational status is particularly important in evaluating threats to the objectivity of the internal auditors. If the internal audit function reports to management, this would be considered a significant threat to the function’s objectivity unless other factors such as those described in paragraph A7 of this SA collectively provide sufficient safeguards to reduce the threat to an acceptable level. A14. In addition, a self-review threat18 is created when the external auditor accepts an engagement to provide internal audit services to an audit client, and the results of those services will be used in conducting the audit. This is because of the possibility that the engagement team will use the results of the internal audit service without properly evaluating those results or without exercising the same level of professional skepticism as would be exercised when the internal audit work is performed by individuals who are not members of the firm. Paragraph 290.173 of the Code of Ethics, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India therefore in the context of  Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements. 18 Attention of the members is also invited to paragraph 2.1 of the Guidance Note on Independence of Auditors, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India."
"Annexure VII 505 provision of internal audit service to financial statement audit clients, specifically provides that “a statutory auditor of an entity cannot be its internal auditor as it will not be possible for him to give an independent and objective opinion”. The said Code of Ethics discusses the threats and the safeguards that can be applied to reduce the threats to an acceptable level in other circumstances. Determining the Nature and Extent of Work of the Internal Audit Function that Can Be Used Factors Affecting the Determination of the Nature and Extent of the Work of the Internal Audit Function that Can Be Used (Ref: Para. 17–19) A15. Once the external auditor has determined that the work of the internal audit function can be used for purposes of the audit, a first consideration is whether the planned nature and scope of the work of the internal audit function that has been performed, or is planned to be performed, is relevant to the overall audit strategy and audit plan that the external auditor has established in accordance with SA 300.19 A16. Examples of work of the internal audit function that can be used by the external auditor include the following:  Testing of the operating effectiveness of controls. Substantive procedures involving limited judgment. Observations of inventory counts. Tracing transactions through the information system relevant to financial reporting. Testing of compliance with regulatory requirements. In some circumstances, audits or reviews of the financial information of subsidiaries that are not significant components to the group (where this does not conflict with the requirements of SA 600).20 A17. The external auditor’s determination of the planned nature and extent of use of the work of the internal audit function will be influenced by the external auditor’s evaluation of the extent to which the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures adequately support the objectivity of the internal auditors and the level of competence of  19 SA 300, Planning an Audit of Financial Statements. 20 SA 600, Using the Work of Another Auditor."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 506 the internal audit function in paragraph 18 of this SA. In addition, the amount of judgment needed in planning, performing and evaluating such work and the assessed risk of material misstatement at the assertion level are inputs to the external auditor’s determination. Further, there are circumstances in which the external auditor cannot use the work of the internal audit function for purpose of the audit as described in paragraph 16 of this SA. Judgments in planning and performing audit procedures and evaluating results (Ref: Para. 18(a), 30(a)) A18. The greater the judgment needed to be exercised in planning and performing the audit procedures and evaluating the audit evidence, the external auditor will need to perform more procedures directly in accordance with paragraph 18 of this SA, because using the work of the internal audit function alone will not provide the external auditor with sufficient appropriate audit evidence. A19. Since the external auditor has sole responsibility for the audit opinion expressed, the external auditor needs to make the significant judgments in the audit engagement in accordance with paragraph 18. Significant judgments include the following:  Assessing the risks of material misstatement;  Evaluating the sufficiency of tests performed;  Evaluating the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern assumption;  Evaluating significant accounting estimates; and  Evaluating the adequacy of disclosures in the financial statements, and other matters affecting the auditor’s report. Assessed risk of material misstatement (Ref: Para. 18(b)) A20. For a particular account balance, class of transaction or disclosure, the higher an assessed risk of material misstatement at the assertion level, the more judgment is often involved in planning and performing the audit procedures and evaluating the results thereof. In such circumstances, the external auditor will need to perform more procedures directly in accordance with paragraph 18 of this SA, and accordingly, make less use of the work of the internal audit function in obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence."
"Annexure VII 507 Furthermore, as explained in SA 200,21 the higher the assessed risks of material misstatement, the more persuasive the audit evidence required by the external auditor will need to be, and, therefore, the external auditor will need to perform more of the work directly. A21. As explained in SA 315,22 significant risks require special audit consideration and therefore the external auditor’s ability to use the work of the internal audit function in relation to significant risks will be restricted to procedures that involve limited judgment. In addition, where the risks of material misstatement is other than low, the use of the work of the internal audit function alone is unlikely to reduce audit risk to an acceptably low level and eliminate the need for the external auditor to perform some tests directly. A22. Carrying out procedures in accordance with this SA may cause the external auditor to reevaluate the external auditor’s assessment of the risks of material misstatement. Consequently, this may affect the external auditor’s determination of whether to use the work of the internal audit function and whether further application of this SA is necessary. Communication with Those Charged with Governance (Ref: Para. 20) A23. In accordance with SA 260(Revised),23 the external auditor is required to communicate with those charged with governance an overview of the planned scope and timing of the audit. The planned use of the work of the internal audit function is an integral part of the external auditor’s overall audit strategy and is therefore relevant to those charged with governance for their understanding of the proposed audit approach. Using the Work of the Internal Audit Function Discussion and Coordination with the Internal Audit Function (Ref: Para. 21) A24. In discussing the planned use of their work with the internal audit function as a basis for coordinating the respective activities, it may be useful to address the following:  The timing of such work. The nature of the work performed. 21 SA 200, paragraph A29. 22 SA 315, paragraph 4(e). 23 SA 260(Revised), paragraph 15."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 508  The extent of audit coverage. Materiality for the financial statements as a whole (and, if applicable, materiality level or levels for particular classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures), and performance materiality. Proposed methods of item selection and sample sizes. Documentation of the work performed. Review and reporting procedures. A25. Coordination between the external auditor and the internal audit function is effective when, for example:  Discussions take place at appropriate intervals throughout the period. The external auditor informs the internal audit function of significant matters that may affect the function. The external auditor is advised of and has access to relevant reports of the internal audit function and is informed of any significant matters that come to the attention of the function when such matters may affect the work of the external auditor so that the external auditor is able to consider the implications of such matters for the audit engagement. A26. SA 20024 discusses the importance of the auditor planning and performing the audit with professional skepticism, including being alert to information that brings into question the reliability of documents and responses to inquiries to be used as audit evidence. Accordingly, communication with the internal audit function throughout the engagement may provide opportunities for internal auditors to bring matters that may affect the work of the external auditor to the external auditor’s attention. 25 The external auditor is then able to take such information into account in the external auditor’s identification and assessment of risks of material misstatement. In addition, if such information may be indicative of a heightened risk of a material misstatement of the financial statements or may be regarding any actual, suspected or alleged fraud, the external auditor can take this into account in the external auditor’s identification of risk of material misstatement due to fraud in accordance with SA 240.26  24 SA 200, paragraphs 15 and A18. 25 SA 315, paragraph A115. 26 SA 315, paragraph A10 in relation to SA 240, The Auditor’s Responsibilities Relating to Fraud in"
"Annexure VII 509 Procedures to Determine the Adequacy of Work of the Internal Audit Function (Ref: Para. 23–24) A27. The external auditor’s audit procedures on the body of work of the internal audit function as a whole that the external auditor plans to use provide a basis for evaluating the overall quality of the function’s work and the objectivity with which it has been performed. A28. The procedures the external auditor may perform to evaluate the quality of the work performed and the conclusions reached by the internal audit function, in addition to re performance in accordance with paragraph 24, include the following:  Making inquiries of appropriate individuals within the internal audit function. Observing procedures performed by the internal audit function. Reviewing the internal audit function’s work program and working papers. A29. The more judgment involved, the higher the assessed risk of material misstatement, the less the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures adequately support the objectivity of the internal auditors, or the lower the level of competence of the internal audit function, the more audit procedures are needed to be performed by the external auditor on the overall body of work of the function to support the decision to use the work of the function in obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to base the audit opinion. Re-performance (Ref: Para. 24) A30. For purposes of this SA, reperformance involves the external auditor’s independent execution of procedures to validate the conclusions reached by the internal audit function. This objective may be accomplished by examining items already examined by the internal audit function or, where it is not possible to do so, the same objective may also be accomplished by examining sufficient other similar items not actually examined by the internal audit function. Reperformance provides more persuasive evidence regarding the adequacy of the work of the internal audit function compared to other procedures the external auditor may perform in paragraph A28. While it is not necessary for the external auditor to do reperformance in each area of work  an Audit of Financial Statements."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 510 of the internal audit function that is being used, some reperformance is required on the body of work of the internal audit function as a whole that the external auditor plans to use in accordance with paragraph 24. The external auditor is more likely to focus reperformance in those areas where more judgment was exercised by the internal audit function in planning, performing and evaluating the results of the audit procedures and in areas of higher risk of material misstatement. Determining Whether, in Which Areas and to What Extent Internal Auditors Can Be Used to Provide Direct Assistance Determining Whether Internal Auditors Can Be Used to Provide Direct Assistance for Purposes of the Audit (Ref: Para. 5, 26–28) A31. In case where the external auditor is prohibited by law or regulation from using internal auditors to provide direct assistance, it is relevant for the principal auditors to consider whether the prohibition also extends to component auditors and, if so, to address this in the communication to the component auditors. A32. As stated in paragraph A7 of this SA, objectivity refers to the ability to perform the proposed work without allowing bias, conflict of interest or undue influence of others to override professional judgments. In evaluating the existence and significance of threats to the objectivity of an internal auditor, the following factors may be relevant:  The extent to which the internal audit function’s organizational status and relevant policies and procedures support the objectivity of the internal auditors.27  Family and personal relationships with an individual working in, or responsible for, the aspect of the entity to which the work relates. Association with the division or department in the entity to which the work relates. Significant financial interests in the entity other than remuneration on terms consistent with those applicable to other employees at a similar level of seniority. Material issued by relevant professional bodies for internal auditors may provide additional useful guidance. 27 See paragraph A7."
"Annexure VII 511 A33. There may also be some circumstances in which the significance of the threats to the objectivity of an internal auditor is such that there are no safeguards that could reduce them to an acceptable level. For example, because the adequacy of safeguards is influenced by the significance of the work in the context of the audit, paragraph 30(a) and (b) prohibits the use of internal auditors to provide direct assistance in relation to performing procedures that involve making significant judgments in the audit or that relate to higher assessed risks of material misstatement where the judgment required in performing the relevant audit procedures or evaluating the audit evidence gathered is more than limited. This would also be the case where the work involved creates a self-review threat, which is why internal auditors are prohibited from performing procedures in the circumstances described in paragraph 30(c) and (d). A34. In evaluating the level of competence of an internal auditor, many of the factors in paragraph A8 of this SA may also be relevant, applied in the context of individual internal auditors and the work to which they may be assigned. Determining the Nature and Extent of Work that Can Be Assigned to Internal Auditors Providing Direct Assistance (Ref: Para. 29–31) A35. Paragraphs A15–A22 of this SA provide relevant guidance in determining the nature and extent of work that may be assigned to internal auditors. A36. In determining the nature of work that may be assigned to internal auditors, the external auditor is careful to limit such work to those areas that would be appropriate to be assigned. Examples of activities and tasks that would not be appropriate to use internal auditors to provide direct assistance include the following:  Discussion of fraud risks. However, the external auditors may make inquiries of internal auditors about fraud risks in the organization in accordance with SA 315.28  Determination of unannounced audit procedures as addressed in SA 240. 28 SA 315, paragraph 6(a)."
"Guidance Note on Report under Section 92E of the Income-tax Act, 1961 512 A37. Similarly, since in accordance with SA 50529 the external auditor is required to maintain control over external confirmation requests and evaluate the results of external confirmation procedures, it would not be appropriate to assign these responsibilities to internal auditors. However, internal auditors may assist in assembling information necessary for the external auditor to resolve exceptions in confirmation responses. A38. The amount of judgment involved and the risk of material misstatement are also relevant in determining the work that may be assigned to internal auditors providing direct assistance. For example, in circumstances where the valuation of accounts receivable is assessed as an area of higher risk, the external auditor could assign the checking of the accuracy of the aging to an internal auditor providing direct assistance. However, because the evaluation of the adequacy of the provision based on the aging would involve more than limited judgment, it would not be appropriate to assign that latter procedure to an internal auditor providing direct assistance. A39. Notwithstanding the direction, supervision and review by the external auditor, excessive use of internal auditors to provide direct assistance may affect perceptions regarding the independence of the external audit engagement. Using Internal Auditors to Provide Direct Assistance (Ref: Para. 34) A40. As individuals in the internal audit function are not independent of the entity as is required of the external auditor when expressing an opinion on financial statements, the external auditor’s direction, supervision and review of the work performed by internal auditors providing direct assistance will generally be of a different nature and more extensive than if members of the engagement team perform the work. A41. In directing the internal auditors, the external auditor may, for example, remind the internal auditors to bring accounting and auditing issues identified during the audit to the attention of the external auditor. In reviewing the work performed by the internal auditors, the external auditor’s considerations include whether the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate in the circumstances, and that it supports the conclusions reached. 29 SA 505, External Confirmations, paragraphs 7 and 16."
